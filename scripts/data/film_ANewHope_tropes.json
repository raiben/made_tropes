Usually this is done for comedic effect, but occasionally it is serious. Sometimes it's both.

But sometimes it's a weird or haunting reflection of the original series that is a native part of the \\\"reality\\\" of the show in which it is found.\\nA pastiche is a very common type of homage, which involves trying to copy the style of a work or artist.\\nIf a series is doing anything deliberately evocative of its own past, then it is an Internal Homage.\\nSee also: Actor Allusion, Homage Shot, Post Modernism, Shout-Out, Trapped in TV Land, Whole Plot Reference.

      "general": "Even OSHA compliance is no guarantee of safety. A mook (usually) standing behind a railing, usually about waist-height, on an elevated surface who is shot during a firefight will invariably fall forward and flip over the railing, falling to his (presumed) demise, probably Wilhelm screaming on the way down. Conversely, someone standing in front of a railing will flip backward over the railing. This occurs even if the mook was shot from the direction of the railing with a weapon that normally throws people violently backwards. The phenomenon that causes this is called Ledge Gravity, and specifies that people will tend to fall in the direction they'll fall furthest because there's more gravity that way.\\nAlthough this technique gained prominence in Westerns with the railed balcony on the second story of every building in a dusty town, it can be found in any setting.\\nIf the ledge is high enough, a Disney Villain Death may occur.\\nNot to be confused with people being killed when they land on a spiked railing."

He may have rethought his position after seeing what Luke does to Threepio in Return of the Jedi.  Of course, now that the Prequel Trilogy has been released, these two characters have retroactively fallen even deeper into this trope: the original films implied that the heyday of the Jedi happened long ago and that even then the Jedi were somewhat rare, but the prequels haphazardly retconned this by showing that the Jedi were all over the place just twenty years earlier.",
      "general": "The Scully is a sci-fi/fantasy character who insists that events can be interpreted according to mundane explanations. They never waver from this view, even though crazy things happen in episode after episode demonstrating how illogical or otherwise bizarre the universe is, prompting lectures from The Protagonist to this effect \\u2014 if they're not busy lecturing everyone else, that is. Once convinced that something is a Windmill, he or she will never step down from this belief no matter the evidence to the contrary, thus becoming a Windmill Crusader himself.\\nHe or she may have no tolerance for flights of fancy whatsoever. If the character is a parent and their child merrily announces that he or she spent the afternoon playing with fairies, they may immediately retort, \\\"fairies don't exist!\\\" There will, of course, be little to no explanation given for why fairies don't exist; the fact of the matter (in their minds) is that they simply don't exist and you're being foolish for even giving the concept a moment's thought. The fact that children play pretend all the time and actually have a fairly firm grasp on what's real and what isn't is lost on them - such foolish thoughts must be squelched from their heads immediately! Likewise, they have no time for fairy tales - for these stories depict things that don't (or shouldn't) exist, which makes them nothing but frivolous poppycock, never mind the symbolic nature, moral lessons, and literary value they hold.\\nThe same extends to any other magical or paranormal subject or fantasy of any kind \\u2014 they have no time to think about or consider such things, and if you've been thinking about it you're an idiot who is wasting your time. End of story.\\nIf magic or the supernatural actually does exist in their world and the character is aware of it, they may try to convince themselves it doesn't exist, or failing that, simply act as if it doesn't matter because respectable people don't go in for such foolishness. Scully Syndrome can ensue in extreme cases, where they are more willing to believe convoluted mundane explanations full of Plot Holes and swamp gas than the fact that they literally just watched an alien spacecraft land, had its pilot get out and introduce themselves, collect plant samples, and fly off again.\\nThere is sometimes a sting in the tail, though, where the Agent Scully's disbelief actually prevents supernatural powers from working- in real life many alleged psychics blame \\\"negative energy\\\" from investigators for causing their abilities to fail, for instance. Quite simply, the Agent Scully does not clap, because they refuse to believe. This can be a powerful protective asset in a setting with dangerous supernatural elements, but should their disbelief ever falter, they can suddenly find themselves completely vulnerable.\\nThe character is often an adult, but in some cases may be a child who is trying too hard to act mature, or how he/she thinks mature people act.\\nDerives its name, obviously, from Dana Scully, a character from The X-Files.\\nAn Agent Scully may also, obviously, be a Spock, and sometimes even a Straw Vulcan. Can be something of a strawman of those who currently doubt supernatural phenomena because of lack of evidence, placing them in a world where evidence of the supernatural is abundant and having them persist in their doubt.\\nA point that most X-Files fans miss (or chose to ignore) is that the original Agent Scully is a deeply religious woman who is staunchly devoted to her Christian faith in spite of her scientific and logical view on the world and life in general; in other words, it wasn't always logical vs. illogical so much as her deep-seated religious belief being in direct opposition with her Modus Operandi as a scientist (in a series where supernatural phenomena of varying natures are abundant nevertheless). When the explanation truly was a miracle, Mulder turned into the skeptic.\\nCompare Flat Earth Atheist and Stupid Scientist. Contrast Agent Mulder."

In French it was il \\u00E9tait une fois and in German it was es war einmal, which literally meant \\\"It was once.\\\" Sometimes it was translated as \\\"Once there was\\\" or \\\"A long time ago,\\\" but most often, this trope was simply translated as \\\"Once upon a time.\\\" Other languages have translated it directly. Russian fairy tales often start \\\"Zhyl-byl...\\\", that is, \\\"Once there lived...\\\". In Ireland it was \\\" There was this man....\\\"\\nwhich comes from the Irish language \\\" Bh\\u00ED fear ann fad\\u00F3....\\\" (There was a man a long time ago...). Armenian folk tales would typically start with \\\"There once was and was not\\\", indicating that the story was fictional.\\nNow, stories that began with \\\"Once Upon a Time\\\" often ended with \\\"...and they all lived Happily Ever After.\\\" But Once never got to the end of the stories \\u2014 he always stayed at the beginning. And that is where he will always be.\\nNow, are you sitting comfortably? Then let's begin. Once upon a time... note\\u00A0there was a boy who decided to stay up late and read TV Tropes. Even though his parents had warned him that doing this was a bad thing, still he was compelled to do so. So, the lights of the screen illuminating his face, he carefully surfed the site, reading trope descriptions and examples, going over works pages and forum threads, until finally he looked at the clock and realized it was well past the reasonable amount of time one would surf the web. And then the boy knew his parents were right \\u2014 that by surfing TV Tropes, he had ruined his life in such a way that he could now never go sleep. He was cursed to forever surf TV Tropes, haunting the YKTTW, quietly drifting from page to page like a ghost in the machine; until one day, he met someone who had been similarly trapped. She was named Trope-tan. Together, they decided that perhaps this wasn't such a lonely place to be stuck. And so they lived and troped Happily Ever After."

However, while it's good to know these things exist and work to minimise them, there's a point where thinking about these things doesn't help and is bad for your mental and physical health. Indeed, it can kill you.\\nThankfully, there's a way to keep sane: humour. People who are easily hurt, or like to keep things 'dignified' and 'serious', may say \\\"This is not a laughing matter.\\\" But the truth is there is a healing power to comedy. If you can make fun of yourself, talk about your problems and have someone laugh with you, you feel better and your problems don't seem quite so bad anymore.\\nThis trope is when you are able to make the best of a bad situation - this is finding something funny even in Hell itself. \\\"Laughter is the best medicine\\\", says the age-old adage. Therefore, these tend to be stories that focus on a select group of individuals who are in recovery or surviving an ordeal. It is highly unlikely for a gag of the week format to be Gallows Humor.

There is something very evocative about fighter engines \\u2014 the promise of power and danger right there in the turbine's whine (or the exhausts' roar). Science fiction versions of the trope will have the fighters make a very similar sound despite not running on turbine engines. This isn't always a case of Space Is Noisy (because they're probably still in the pressurized hangar) but it's definitely common.\\nThis is closely related to Red Alert with its attending imagery of lights flashing and klaxons sounding as the pilots in their flight gear race for their fighters while the ground crew calmly preps them for take-off as their commander goes over the PA with something like \\\"All fighters, Scramble!\\\"\\nIn anime, you always have to have the commander gesture impressively on the Bridge when they do this. In fact, this usually shows up in the Opening Credits.\\nSometimes this trope is subverted, with the pilots attempting to scramble only to have their airfield or mothership disabled or destroyed before they can launch. That would be an example of Sitting Duck.\\nThe Lock and Load aspect of the trope isn't Truth in Television, unfortunately. The reason being that since planes and fighters are highly sophisticated machines with lots of moving parts and where something as simple as a rag in an intake can cause disaster, there are a lot of requirements and checklists to check before flight can occur. The most technologically advanced military in the world, best case, can go from call to wheels up in... 15 minutes (nevermind actually getting to where they're going). This time can be reduced by leaving the planes on the runway with the engines running and rotating pilots in as they get tired... but this means the planes are constantly using up jet fuel the entire time.\\nA Sister Trope to Lock and Load Montage, Technology Porn.\\nCompare Engaging Chevrons, Transformation Sequence, Standard Establishing Spaceship Shot.\\n\\nExamples"

She will be more averse to the Horrible Camping Trip than any other member of the family (and probably act like a City Mouse on that trip), near-continuously complaining about breaking her nails or how much she would rather be at the mall.\\nShe tends to be a supporting character, with the show's focus usually only being put on her in the event of a Very Special Episode about drugs, underaged sex, etc. Often (but by no means always) an Alpha Bitch or The Brainless Beauty.

Kind of hard to go to work with a smile with that hanging over your head.\\nAnother demotivator is the Big Bad's reaction when their minion(s) lose to the hero. Assuming they don't shoot the fellow then and there (which is, again, not exactly good for morale no matter what Machiavelli said) they will likely yell \\\"You Have Failed Me!\\\" and use their Agony Beam on the poor sap. After the poor minion is done screaming his guts out (hopefully not literally) their boss will say \\\"Do not fail me again! For I shall not show you such mercy a second time.\\\" Whether they actually follow through depends on how dark the show is. In animation, even Team Rocket or the Quirky Miniboss Squad will get off with minimal verbal abuse, but others... not so much.\\nThe Villainous Demotivator can be any threat that a Big Bad or The Dragon makes towards a lower ranking minion that they will be hurt or killed if they fail to perform their job. Assuming their skills will always be needed in his plots (and thus he would need to take the trouble of finding a replacement if he kills the Evil Minion), this makes sense as a negative motivational tool, and a nice little Kick the Dog that can fuel a Mistreatment-Induced Betrayal or a Mook-Face Turn. Other instances of this trope can happen without the villain ever meaning to demotivate their minions. He might do something so vile it reminds them of their ethics, or admit his plan will kill one of their loved ones.\\nMay come back to haunt him as an explanation why a minion won't Give Me a Sword.

      "ANewHope": "The original outline of A New Hope had scenes and concepts which were reused in the sequels.\\n A chase through an asteroid field became one of the major action sequences in The Empire Strikes Back.\\n Cloud City in Empire was based on concept art for the Imperial capital city (which was mostly replaced with scenes aboard the Death Star).\\n A ground battle at the Rebel base on Yavin was later adapted to the Battle of Endor (a similar forested planetoid) in Return of the Jedi. And while Jedi turned the Wookiee planet into the Ewok one, Revenge of the Sith actually went to Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk.\\n In the original script, Tatooine would have been named Utapau. When The Phantom Menace rolled around, Lucas tried to use the name with the planet that ultimately became Naboo. He was finally able to use the name in Revenge of the Sith for the planet where Obi-Wan Kenobi fights General Grevious.\\n The TIE Bombers featured prominently during the asteroid scenes were based on concept drawings for an Imperial boarding craft that was supposed to be shown boarding Princess Leia's ship at the beginning of A New Hope.",
      "general": "So you've finished writing your new adventure film. It has everything you can imagine, with a very evil villain, a mysterious female-lead and even a biplane chase! The studio loves it and you get it green-lit. But as you move into pre-production, you notice the film needs to get trimmed down. The biplane chase was great, but you know it has to go, as it adds too little to the plot. A shame, it even got storyboarded and most of the models were already built. But with it left out, the pacing is improved and the change was for the better. The film eventually gets released to rave reviews and great box-office numbers. So the studio calls you up for a sequel! You start working on script and realize something:\\n...I could work the biplane chase into this one!\\nThe sequence remains virtually identical to its first outing, except that this time a different girl is behind our hero. Just because you didn't use it the first time, doesn't mean it never can be used, instead it can be refitted for the sequel.\\nThe reasons for dropping a sequence is usually:\\n Pacing: Some sequences just end up being too long in the end, or there is one chase too many.\\n Budgetary or time-constraints: Everything in a film costs money, A LOT of money. Sometimes some things will just be too expensive and needs to be cut. In other cases, to avoid a delay you need to take something out.\\n Technological: Sometimes, the technology needed to produce the sequence (or at least on budget) is not there yet.\\nAnother variation is when doing an adaptation of a work, a scene from an earlier installments makes into a later one.\\nSometimes it isn\\u2019t a sequence that's re-used, but can be things like sets or props made for an earlier installment.\\nMost of these tend to be removed early, anywhere from the script writing to having gotten some sets built.\\nThis is mostly a film, TV or video-game based trope, as readers have a lot more tolerance for length and writing an extra sequence doesn\\u2019t cost anything other than time.\\nFor video-games, it can be related to Dummied Out. With the advent of DLC, this allows makers to finish parts that were not in the main game. The difference of how is received varies greatly as sometimes you are paying more for what originally was going to be included in the original game, while other times it can be expanded into a much larger role (see Fallout: New Vegas example below)."

Surely the wacky adventures Luke must have had while growing up on Tatooine had much to do with flying a military space fighter at extremely high speeds in a tunnel while evading fire from the most skilled pilots of the galactic empire\\n T-16s are, as explained in the Expanded Universe, common civilian craft, the equivalent of a Cessna. The advantage it gave Luke to have flown a T-16 is the fact that the T-65 X-Wing has almost the same control scheme, being made by the same shipyard. And T-16s have a low-power (by Star Wars standards) laser. Luke wouldn't have had to evade the Empire chasing him down just for flying around in his legally-owned civilian-grade aircraft.\\n Luke also mentions that the Death Star run will be \\\"Just like Beggar's Canyon back home\\\", meaning he already has some experience with flying in confined spaces(though in an atmosphere, not space).

However, this trope is averted nearly as often as it's played straight, especially among Anti Heroes who are willing to screw over the whole world for the ones they love.\\nOf course, it isn't always The Hero who has to make the decision.

Dystopias are easy to imagine but hard to set up in Real Life. The villains have won the day, and now it looks like humanity is doomed. But then the villains learn a harsh lesson: running an actual country or company or what have you based purely on some flavor of evil is hard. Forget making all the trains run on time, just ensuring all the Black Shirts get a check on payday so they don't rebel is a titanic effort.

Even if you avoid it, you are certain to get a plotting and backstabbing orgy behind you, or a horridly inefficient and ossified bureaucracy, or both.\\nWorst of all, humanity is resistant to the creation of a society that they believe is against their well-being.

Usually results in the regime being Fascist, but Inefficient. See Despotism Justifies the Means and Dystopia Justifies the Means where dystopic conditions may be allowed to foster just to keep the ruler in power, thereby averting this trope since the crapsack conditions are in themselves a form of governance. See also Bread and Circuses, where a leader consciously avoids dystopia for this very reason.\\nTypically leads to A World Half Full situation.\\nNo Real Life Examples, Please!

Why would you include a fail-safe that automatically \\u2014 for example \\u2014 lowers the shields of your starship when the console that controls the thing defending your starship is destroyed? And why wouldn't aforementioned vital system not have a secondary control console somewhere, or at least a Shield Dimmer Switch?\\nIronically, the only systems that don't do this are usually also the ones that will cause a disaster if they can't be shut down, such as the main reactor.\\nIt never sets off an alarm, either. Destroying an Insecurity Camera doesn't trigger some kind of automatic defence system, facility-wide alert or even notify the janitor. It just turns off the camera. Apperently nobody is watching the monitors for these cameras either, since they don't seem to notice when one suddenly goes offline.\\nThis is most often a major flaw of the Big Bad's Doomsday Device and/or Supervillain Lair. But even the good guys fall victim to this with their extremely poor McGuffin-guarding security systems. Most often goes hand-in-hand with Computer Equals Monitor and Made of Explodium.\\nNot to be confused with Inventional Wisdom, where a literal switch brings about destruction of idiotic proportions. See No Ontological Inertia for a similar (and more illogical) trope.\\nNeedless to say, while this trope can occasionally work in Real Life as in the few examples below, sometimes it is more dangerous to outright try to destroy something to \\\"turn it off,\\\" especially if the something in question involves explosives/petrochemicals, other dangerous chemicals, radioactivity, or something similar. Trying to destroy an enclosed radioactive source, for example, may only increase the danger by opening the source and leading to an uncontrolled and immediately fatal release of radiation, and trying to destroy a suspected bomb will often make it explode. Meth labs are another example - even moving any of the components of a meth lab or being in its presence can lead to fatal or chronically injurious poisoning and/or an explosion, as many police officers not trained in safe chemical cleanup have unfortunately found out."

      "general": "As far as humankind has dominated the sea, sailors have been considered as one of the lowest links of the social hierarchy, since these men spend many, many weeks at sea and usually not having a steady place to live, traveling a lot and usually, but not always, using the little wages they have on lowly pleasures. Hence, the typical image got through times on the settlements made to give these men a place to spend their wages and satisfy their urges.\\nCommon elements of these Wretched Hive-types of ports are shady merchants, run-down taverns with lots of drinking and gambling, cheap whores, barrels and crates everywhere, and lots and lots of fish. But we have managed to classify them in two types:\\n Booty Bay, usually the hangout of your favorite pirates, whether they're idle or not. Expect them to be on an unknown location where authorities try to be on the margin of things and raids every once in a while. Set either somewhere in the Caribbean or in Southeast Asia, though not exclusively, expect it to be on the 18th or the early 19th century. And yes, it's full of both kinds of Pirate Booty.\\n Stormalong Harbor, generally associated with the novel Moby-Dick and a staple of the New England culture in general, though it is not a requirement to be. Expect sea shanties, whalers, maidens who wait for their men to return, and privateers around, usually set during the 19th century or the early 20th century.\\nThis trope still has its echoes in present-day fiction, as dockyards remain a popular setting for police to uncover contraband of all sorts. Its friendlier counterpart is the Port Town."

      "ANewHope": "In A New Hope, na\\u00EFve Farm Boy Luke goes from cleaning up droids to destroying the Death Star. While it helps that The Force was strong with him, his aunt Beru and uncle Owen gave him the kind of stable family life that helped him resist The Dark Side.\\n Subverted in the case of his father Anakin Skywalker, who had as good an upbringing as a slave could have thanks to his mother. However because he still grew up in a harsh environment as a slave, there were potential problems (as Yoda sensed in him.) Furthermore, his mentors (acting as parental subttitues of sorts) were caring, but also aloof. When she died, horribly and just after Anakin rescued her, he took it very badly and the fear of losing his wife and unborn children as well were key factors in his fall to The Dark Side, (though Palpatine easily capitalized on this to convert him).\\n The Star Wars Expanded Universe actually gives many justifications for Anakin Skywalker's eventual fall. After being adopted by the Jedi, the other Jedi didn't exactly welcome him lovingly. Instead, Anakin spent his adolescent years being mostly alienated by his masters and peers; he also would rather clutter the Temple's halls with droids he built and join illegal street races than meditate, and the few genuine friends he did make ended up dead. By the time he made the choice to fall, Mace Windu was fully aware that Skywalker was a tangled emotional wreck who had been bounced around between conflicting allies and didn't know where to turn, but unfortunately Mace didn't know how he could help Anakin with his troubles without making them worse. Prequel-era Jedi in general are often portrayed as not being very competent regarding psychological stability despite all their preaching about peace and calmness, which is why many Jedi had rebelled during the Clone Wars.",
      "general": "\\\"Heroes are made, not born\\\" is a common and unstated theme in a lot of works. Though a good many heroic origins proudly trot out heroes who have been raised in The Spartan Way and can look Death in the eye-sockets without blinking before leaving their Tibetan monastery home, quite a few grew up Farm Boys who never picked up anything sharper than a hoe, though those can be quite a handful.\\nIn fact, heroes with a down to earth upbringing tend to have a unique advantage over the more Badass and epic ones: they're more centered. While they won't be saints, they'll have a strong enough moral compass to navigate most moral dilemmas, resist The Dark Side, and even refute Hannibal Lectures that more emotionally fragile heroes struggle with. If they gain super powers they won't forget \\\"the little people\\\" and turn into a Smug Super with delusions of grandeur. Though they didn't gain the crime fighting prowess of a lifetime of Charles Atlas training, or the street savvy of an orphan with a Dark and Troubled Past, they also didn't sacrifice basic skills or their social life.\\nThese differences are often contrasted by pairing these characters together as an Action Hero and an Action Survivor in an Action Duo or pitting them against each other as Technician vs. Performer. The contrast can even be made an integral plot point by pitting the homey hero against a Tyke Bomb Raised by Orcs, and exploring just how much upbringing can damn or redeem. Frequently, this is played with by revealing the hero has Secret Legacy for evil In the Blood. In these cases, it's usually left implicit (or explicitly stated) that without their upbringing they'd have gone evil. The Anti Anti Christ in particular usually has this for a background.\\nEven handed authors will acknowledge that the \\\"classical\\\" hero is more able at their job because of their sacrifices, while the more \\\"normal\\\" one is a hero because that which was not sacrificed is what makes them heroic. More biased tellings can make one or the other out as the better hero, usually slanting towards the meek, though Never Be a Hero does crop up.\\nOne reason why Turn Out Like His Father can often keep the child from being Evil.\\nAlso see Misery Builds Character, Nature Versus Nurture (and especially Nurture Over Nature), Muggle Foster Parents.

But then WHAM - something unexpected happens, and the tide turns in the heroes' favor, allowing them to overcome the villain and win.\\nThis is what we call a Near Villain Victory, where the bad guys look like they're going to win only to get defeated at the last moment.\\nIt is a given that in battles between the forces of good and evil, the heroes will win 99% of the time and the villains will be defeated in the end. So, the writers will come up with scenarios that stack the odds in the villains' favor and give them minor victories, thus raising tension by getting the audience to think that maybe this time the hero won't save the day.\\nOften, it's the very fact the villain is so close to victory that results in their downfall. Maybe they've got the heroes on the run, maybe they've got every right to think they're going to win or already have... then they get cocky. Because they already declared victory, they come to think the hero is no longer a real threat to them. Sometimes, they might even ignore the hero to focus on putting the finishing touches to their plan or announce themselves the supreme Evil Overlord, confident they've got nothing to worry about. This gives the heroes the opening to make a big, crippling blow when the Big Bad is least expecting it.\\nNote: There is in fact a very real and very specific word for this trope. That word is eucatastrophe. (It's also worthwhile to note who invented this word. Though J. R. R. Tolkien's definition stresses that somehow things go good, not solely because a group of hard working Badass heroes are turning it around, but because of some intervention or action beyond the heroes' control - in effect, a miracle - that makes victory possible.)\\nWhen this trope gets subverted and the villain still wins anyway, you have a Hope Spot.\\nCompare You Can't Thwart Stage One. Might overlap with Darkest Hour. Often used to set up a plot about coming Back from the Brink when it occurs in video games. If it gets bad enough, then Only the Author Can Save Them Now.

If an Anti-Hero utters it, it's to emphasize their dark (or at least rebellious) nature. If a villain utters it to another villain, it's to show that they're Eviler Than Thou.\\nFinally, if a villain utters it to a hero (particularly if they've done a Face-Heel Turn, though usually their past life is relegated to backstory), it determines their fate: If they speak this line with contempt, then they're irredeemable and will die; if they speak it with regret, then The Power of Friendship will prove them wrong and... well, they'll probably die anyway, but they'll feel better about it.\\nOccasionally, mentioning the old life may be a Berserk Button.

In a modern land army, however, such a thing would be very unusual (excepting an officer taking a very short visit to scope out the terrain while planning a major offensive), and typically would only happen if the country gets invaded by complete surprise, and/or the enemy gets very deep very fast.\\nWhile seen as highly heroic, there are significant drawbacks to this, especially in modern settings. Battles hinge on minute-by-minute decision making and updates must be frequently provided to the general staff.

Or maybe not. Whatever). These are all well and good, but sometimes the Big Bad isn't gracious enough to come to you. In that case, you'd better go to them.\\nThat means it's time to gear up and assault the bad guy's home base. Sure, maybe it's guarded by countless extremely well-trained warriors, a squad of bounty hunters looking for your head, and even The Dragon, but what choice do you have? Maybe the villain's stole your secret sauce recipe, and he's not afraid to use it. Maybe he's gonna force your girlfriend to marry him. Maybe he just can't be trusted not to come back worse than before. In any case, the only way to stop him is to take him down.\\nIn Real Life, particularly during the Middle Ages, actually storming the castle was the tactic of last resort, due to how most fortifications are built specifically to give the defenders every advantage possible. Hence why they're called \\\"fortifications\\\". Any sort of direct assault on properly built and manned fortifications required a hell of a numerical advantage, very solid morale, and often repeated attacks\\u2014and even then it would be an absolute bloodbath. More often sieges were won by cutting off the defenders from supplies and starving them to death or surrender (which could take years), by breaching the defenses from the outside and marching in that way (not always practical), or by convincing enemy soldiers within the defenses to Turn Coat and let you in (very difficult). Going through the front door is almost always a suicide mission (assuming it's even possible), but it sure is entertaining.\\nWhile Storming The Castle can take place before the story's climax, the results are generally less dramatic. If a villain does this to the heroes, it's All Your Base Are Belong to Us and/or The Siege, in which a small number of heroes Hold the Line against numerically superior invaders. Weirdly, the good guys tend to win no matter who's attacking what... or at least they do most of the time.\\nMay constitute a Suicide Mission. Compare Foe-Tossing Charge, which is on a smaller scale.\\nIn a variant, instead of directly attacking the castle with massive forces, a small party will sneak in (through the sewers, disguised as delivering supplies, Dressing as the Enemy, etc.) and attempt to take the castle from within.\\n\\nExamples"

The film makers feel a need to \\\"top themselves\\\" in a sort of way.\\nTake an action sequel, which has more explosions and fist/gun/martial arts fights than the previous film. Or a slasher sequel, which has more deaths, in more gory (and less realistic) ways.

Wrong elements can often be the toilet humor, sexual situations, flanderization or meaningless action sequences.\\nHowever, choose the right element(s), and the sequel may even be considered superior to the first film.

      "general": "Long running series often have to experiment a little before they find their niche: sometimes there are concepts abandoned early on that were fascinating, either because they were potentially good ideas back then, or they just clash so much with the later tone of the series. In short, the first installment is a \\\"prototype\\\", like a pilot of a first episode.\\nIf the series improves after abandoning these elements, it often leads to a Growing the Beard moment. For something similar applied to individual characters, see Characterization Marches On. A specific sub-trope of this dealing with early installments resembling the real world is Earth Drift. When early characters disappear entirely with no explanations, that's Chuck Cunningham Syndrome (or even Dropped After the Pilot, if it happens in the very first episode). Might be the result of Plot Tumors, Art Evolution and Continuity Drift.\\nThere will always be some fans who view the current incarnation of a series as They Changed It, Now It Sucks.\\nWhen this happens to themes that become popular after the fact because of a work, and are only actually codified elsewhere, it is a subtrope of Unbuilt Trope.\\nCompare New First Comics, Lost in Imitation, and Adaptation Displacement. Contrast First Installment Wins and Later Installment Weirdness. When a character displays this, it's Characterization Marches On (or Flanderization, when it essentially happens in reverse). May be the Oddball in the Series. See also Meet Your Early Installment Weirdness.\\nA special note on the trope in video games: there, it is often the counterpart to Spiritual Successor. A series may evolve in a drastically different direction from its first installment in a technical sense, abandoning core gameplay mechanics or changing them in drastic ways, while retaining the setting (general background lore, characters etc.), although elements can be added or retconned. This can happen if the developer for an intellectual property held by a publisher changes or merely if a developer wishes to keep a recognizable, established IP, but adapt to a new player demographic or emulate gameplay seen in another revolutionary title. Such changes result in an early installment weirdness when the sequels are compared with the first installment .In contrast, a game which tries to imitate a forerunner title mostly in gameplay terms (copying/refining particular \\\"revolutionary\\\" aspects, the entire gameplay or just the general \\\"feeling\\\" of the game), but is not part of the forerunners' IP, e.g. if the rights to the IP are held by a different publisher, and so uses a different setting, it's usually a Spiritual Successor."

      "ANewHope": "George Lucas is hugely infamous for constant tweaking of his films after they're \\\"finished\\\", starting all the way back to a 1981 re-release of A New Hope where it got its current name (Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope), Star Wars was its original name and was eventually backpedaled into becoming the title of the franchise. He has said the reasons behind some of the changes were based on things they wanted to do but were unable to visualize with the budget or technology of the time, although some fans have misrepresented it as Lucas claiming every change was what he originally intended. A 2004 interview with Lucas has him explain his feelings on the subject:\\n The 20th Anniversary re-releases to theaters were billed as having newly included scenes, an additional 5 million dollars was spent on the new features. There are actually dozens, if not hundreds, of little changes made, most of which fans were ambivalent about (most are seamless unless doing an actual frame-by-frame comparison). The most infamous one was Han shooting Greedo in the cantina after a tense standoff which was altered to have Han dodge a \\\"warning shot\\\" by Greedo and return fire; it changes Han from a Nominal Hero into a Pragmatic Hero. This led to the internet meme of \\\"Han Shot First!\\\"\\n The DVD release of the original trilogy included new changes to better align with the prequels, including an image of Naboo in the Nations of the World Montage at the end of Return of the Jedi. In addition, some changes were made to fix the new Special Effects Failures that happened with the alteration, including a less Off Model CG Jabba the Hutt in a scene added in the 20th anniversary, and improving the matte lines of the rancor. They even cleaned up the \\\"Han Shot First\\\" scene by making it more of a simultaneous action (it's rumored the change only took place because of differing standards with the ratings board and PG movies, PG-13 didn't exist at the time of the original). Another change that didn't get criticized was changing the original Emperor hologram from The Empire Strikes Back with one played by Ian Mc Diarmid, making sure Palpatine remains consistent through all films.\\n A good deal of the enduring backlash comes with that Lucas has also been pretty apathetic about releasing the originals in their unaltered form. The limited DVD release was a Vanilla Edition based off a quick transfer from the laserdisc print made in the early 90's.\\n The restorations and resulting transfers also suffer from Digital Destruction, with lost color depth and the like from turning the contrast knob way up and other inept use of settings. It's unlikely the original, already bold and colorful, palette will ever return. The limited DVD based on the laserdisc transfer is more faithful but still washed out and has plenty of compression artifacts on fast motion.",
      "general": "Sometimes film directors are not fully satisfied with their movies, and want to go back and reedit them, sometimes taking out scenes that they don't like and added scenes that were originally cut from the film. More recently, studios have produced \\\"extended\\\" or \\\"unrated\\\" versions of movies that the directors were already satisfied with, as a promotional gimmick to attract potential DVD buyers. This is generally considered a Re Cut.\\nTHIS trope goes one step past that, where a work is drastically changed by its creators (and sometimes not even them) to update the work with modern technology or new footage that was not available or recorded at the time the work was originally created. Film Purists (both critics and directors) sometimes take issue with it, believing that altering the original film is diluting the charm of the original or, worse, altering the context of scenes in how they played out originally (Similar complaints are leveled towards a Re Cut in general, believing a theatrical release should be the end of editing). These changes include:\\n \\\"Surround sound\\\" mixes of films originally released with mono soundtracks.\\n Sound added to a silent film, this can be more acceptable when the original silent film was screened with live music at the theaters, and they just add that same music to it.\\n A black and white film being colorized.\\n Replacing what was originally a Special Effect Failure (sometimes producing an irony in that the replacement is equally bad).\\n Adding new effects to existing scenes.\\n Newly recorded dialogue/shots.\\n Color, hue and saturation changes to take advantage of newer formats. note\\u00A0 This happens often incidentally rather than intentionally, the nature of various image and viewing formats makes it almost impossible to say what was the original version as seen 100 years ago. Thus examples of this type are more for deliberate alterations.\\nNamed for George Lucas, who did this to a few of his films, most notably the first three Star Wars films (A New Hopenote\\u00A0which didn't even receive a title until its altered version, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi). Fans have widely criticized the reissues of the original Star Wars series, which makes a very strange contrast with films otherwise clearly made between 1976-1983 but having bits and pieces of modern CG tacked on. See the film examples for more on this and Lucas.\\nMany times in the case of sequels and otherwise expanded franchises, these new versions are meant to help the franchise align better both visually and potentially fix Continuity Snarls. You can expect considerable backlash when this trope appears, but as always consider that Tropes Are Not Bad. Art often has flaws, sometimes to its own detriment, and altering or \\\"correcting\\\" those flaws may allow for further generations to appreciate its strengths better. Consider every silent movie ever made and how well audiences can appreciate it if no orchestral music was included on the modern viewing format simply because that is not how it was originally seen.\\nThis process is sometimes mistaken for a Remaster. In actuality, film restoration involves preserving the original as much as possible. Colorization has a similar negative effect on people. People like Ted Turner restored the films in his library prior to colorizing them, and simultaneously released the restored black and white films alongside the colorized versions. This helped preserve black and white films for future generations. Nevertheless, most criticism comes from the fact that many believe colorization shouldn't have been done at all, and they are perhaps justified in their anger when one sees how predominant the colorized version often is when attempting to purchase a film.\\nSee also Orwellian Retcon, where the work is altered to fit with later works in the same story, and Digital Destruction, which is a milder and often ignorant/nonmalicious version of the same effect. The musical version of this trope is The Not Remix, while Gaming examples would fall under Updated Re-release and more serialized worksnote\\u00A0e.g. Comics, Webcomics, TV Shows, Fanfics get New First Comics."

If not an actual Badass Princess, she tends to be otherwise highly placed, or at least look and act like it. If she's not gentle-mannered she may be an Aloof Dark-Haired Girl or arrogant and generally prissy and might become subject to a Defrosting Ice Queen scenario. Often, she's simply The Stoic.\\nIn RPGs, female roles tend to be limited to magic use, but sometimes women get to take on more physical roles in combat, and that leads us to a different Odd Couple pair: the Lady of War and the Cute Bruiser.\\nCharacter-design wise, she doesn't tend to be held up as a sex symbol the way most female warriors are, or at least not quite so obviously. The Lady of War does have her own charm in a cool, collected, Nicole Kidman way. She's also very unlikely to be paired with the protagonist \\u2014 that's what White Mages are for \\u2014 unless there is no White Mage. In any case, she almost certainly occupies a firm place in the hearts of at least a minority of the fandom. (see Amazon Chaser)\\nA Lady of War is almost always given an elegant weapon that emphasizes her femininity \\u2014 often a bow, rapier or naginata, all weapons that have a certain choreographic element in the way they're wielded. They also allow her to avoid getting her hands dirty and usually invoke Wouldn't Hit a Girl as a result. If guns are the norm, she's likely to prefer an easily-concealed revolver with deadly aim, as opposed to an automatic. If the story deals with martial arts, she'll use a \\\"refined\\\" fighting style like Tai Chi or Aikijutsu, or will be given the gymnastic prowess to engage in some variant of She-Fu.\\nAlso expect her Impossibly Cool Clothes to still reflect her position. She might even wear a Battle Ballgown.\\nIn terms of physical capabilities, she's usually some form of the Fragile Speedster (and/or Glass Cannon, if a ranged fighter), but it's not unheard of for her to be a Jack of All Stats or Mighty Glacier/Glacier Waif, especially if she wears armor.\\nIf she were a preteen, she'd be a Little Miss Badass.\\nContrasted by Short Tank or Bokukko Cute Bruisers. Where the Lady of War is about grace and reserve, the tomboyish Cute Bruiser is more about unrestrained passion and power. The former also tends to be older than the latter.

Compare Silk Hiding Steel, for a woman who does her fighting in the court or parlor and with a fan and words instead of spear and shield.\\nA subtrope of Action Girl, though not all Action Girls qualify as Ladies of War if they lack the calm, dignified demeanor. Essentially, she's the Distaff Counterpart to an Officer and a Gentleman. A Lady of War who uses magic rather than a melee weapon is a Lady of Black Magic, although a female Magic Knight can fit both. May be the female half of a Battle Couple.

In the early years of both World Wars, subs often operated this way by surfacing near enemy merchant ships and forcing them to stop to be boarded, and commandeered or sunk after evacuating the crew. This was rather practical for both parties, since the ship's crew was spared death, and the sub's nation gained the resources of the plundered ships. But in both wars, sooner or later some idiot did something to upset the status quo, such as the British disguising armed ships as merchants, and thus subs were forced to adopt the torpedo-first-ask-questions-later strategy.\\n\\nExamples"

The fact that they would for all intents and purposes be personal aircraft, and require the same regulations and specialized skill as planes and helicopters is a big reason why we haven't seen any in our lifetimes. The other big reason is that the requirements of flight and the requirements of driving don't have a lot of overlap, thus any vehicle designed to do both is going to do both poorly due to the necessary engineering compromises. Several flying cars have been invented in Real Life, but the concept has always ended up getting scrapped because said flying cars used up a lot of fuel... and had a penchant for crash-landing when they ran out note\\u00A0Airplanes are specifically designed to glide to the ground in the case of engine failure, whereas a flying car would just plummet..

In many cases, this is either the result of or comes along with a genre shift, as instead of just trying to top the original, the makers will be trying something entirely new (see the Alien and Terminator examples). In addition, this seems to be common with sequels to superhero films. This may be because genre conventions demand (or at least, strongly encourage) a Super Hero Origin story in the first movie, which takes up a good chunk of the plot and screen time with a relatively uninteresting everyman character before we even get a chance to see any super-heroics. Sequels tend to work well if any change is organic, or a plot was built up in the previous installments.\\nIt's possible that in the musical world, even better sequel is the rule rather the exception, considering that an artist's first album (though still good) may have been recorded when they were still trying to figure out their style. Also common in video games, where the sequel is often built on the technological and fictional foundation of the first, significantly reducing the time needed to come up with or adapt new technology or build the game's world, and allowing the developers to focus on enhancing the things that worked and prune the things that didn't.

This is because Europe had been at war with itself practically non-stop for the better part of a millenia, somehow without a single continent-spanning Empire coming into being as a result of it (as per the world norm) standard-issue sets of plate became more common but remained extremely expensive items.\\nSo, after a battle or tournament, armor would be removed, cleaned thoroughly, repaired as necessary, and not put back on until the next engagement (shirts of mail or plates sewn onto fabric were sometimes worn under one's outermost layer of clothing, as a pre-gunpowder bulletproof vest, but that's not this trope.)\\nSome RPGs get around this by having a character in just a breastplate, possibly with shoulder pauldrons. Still pretty uncomfortable pajamas.\\nIt may be justified in the case of magical armor; the enchantments may be for more than increasing defenses. Another common justification is that it's a Clingy Costume, and for whatever reason they literally can't take it off.\\nOften seen in the case of Powered Armor \\u2014 which may be justified since the Powered Armor might be designed to be comfortable for longer periods of wearingnote\\u00A0with climate control, power assist, and sanitary waste removal, especially if its wearer is a Man in the Machine. Often a symptom of Limited Wardrobe. The 24-Hour Armor combined with the Rule of Funny may result in Boogie Knights. Compare with the Ermine Cape Effect.\\nDoesn't really apply to Bulletproof Vests, which certain people actually do wear all day. If someone spends time in the vicinity of a suit of Animated Armor without knowing its true nature, their working theory will probably be that it's a person wearing 24-Hour Armor."

In fact, the Evil Overlord List states that bounty hunters should only be hired for money; those that love the thrill of the chase are too likely to give the prey a chance to get away. Of course even this can backfire if The Hero is Genre Savvy and has access to the funds to pay said Hired Guns more to turn on the villain.\\nThis is a sub-trope of Not in This for Your Revolution. Money, Dear Boy is when it happens in Real Life. Villains who say this are likely to be Punch Clock Villains who work for the bad guys because Evil Pays Better, and might show that Even Evil Has Standards. On the other hand it might show they're a Greedy creep who doesn't care about anyone. Contrast the Psycho for Hire, who while equally villainous, has other motivations. Compare to Signed Up for the Dental.\\nThis may also provide an Evil Versus Oblivion motive if the Big Bad proposes either to destroy everything, or even simply to destroy the economy.

      "general": "The Evil Genius is a standard character in the Five-Bad Band dynamic (and the Evil Counterpart of The Smart Guy). They're usually rather high-ranked, commonly below The Dragon but above the Quirky Miniboss Squad. They are almost exclusively male except in fiction that either has an unusually high female ratio or a female motif for its villains. The Evil Genius is obviously intelligent, and is the one in charge of the Wave Motion Gun or shipping the nukes into the country or resurrecting the Lost Superweapon or what have you. This character is usually the one that will demonstrate to the Big Bad how to use a particular MacGuffin. They're usually a Mad Scientist, a military tactician, a specialist in a particular field (such as computers or electronics), or has ties to The Government (or a combination), so they're in the best position to deliver the goodies to the Evil Overlord. In medieval fantasy settings, this role is often played by an evil strategist, rogue/spymaster, or a dark wizard (provided they aren't also the Big Bad).\\nJust like the Smart Guy, this character is very frequently described as physically unimposing. Within the Five-Bad Band, the Evil Genius tends to rank lowest in the likeability department both In-Universe and with the fan base.\\nAlthough they tend to be the most intelligent, that intelligence usually never translates into political savvy, business acumen or leadership ability all of which rely more on street smarts, people skills and charisma than just technical knowledge. As a result, the evil genius is usually never the top dog. But he's still closer to the top than most.\\nBecause an Evil Genius is not easily replaced and because he's not a realistic contender for the number one spot, his position is often more secure and less precarious than that of The Dragon or even the Big Bad. He usually doesn't need to worry about nasty things like Klingon Promotion eliminating him from the game.\\nProne to being Bad Boss'd when the ridiculously circuitous plan inevitably fails or if they are no longer needed and viewed as a liability.\\nAn Evil Genius who is also the Big Bad will frequently be The Chessmaster and maybe even a Magnificent Bastard. They can also show up as members of Quirky Miniboss Squads, but then are usually made significantly less effective by virtue of their quirkiness. They often are also Morally Ambiguous Doctorate.\\nNot to be confused with the Diabolical Mastermind simulation game Evil Genius, which has its own page. Nor the books by Catherine Jinks, which involve a School for Scheming aimed at creating these.\\n\\nExamples"

The viewer is often presented with a different visual, such as background scenery, a villain's sinister reaction, or the hero or another sympathetic character looking on in horror, accompanied by the audio cue that lets us know we'd rather not be watching \\u2014 a protracted scream that goes on for several seconds.\\nAdditionally, it's not always horror in the classic bloody and gory sense. Sometimes it exists in the mind of an individual, and the scream is their reaction to perceived or imagined situations or consequences. But don't confuse it with Distant Reaction Shot.\\nIn comedy, this is often parodied with strange items flying at the onlookers and odd noises.

Subsequently, their failures involve firing at a moving target that is returning fire over a great distance and firing on targets under decent cover from the bad end of a choke point - both things that would wreck the accuracy of even the best marksmen. As outlined above, the rest of the movie would have had the Stormtroopers under orders to let the heroes escape.",

The good guys (the non-Red Shirt ones, at least - and sometimes even them, too) can stand in the middle of the firefight and never get hit, and can pick off any bad guy with even the most casually-aimed shot while the bad guys seem unable to hit the broad side of a barn.\\nThis is a degree of Truth in Television, as by far most shots fired in firefights or combat are misses. Some sources report that in WWII, the average soldier needed to fire two hundred rounds for every hit scored on an enemy; numerous other examples are mentioned in the Real Life section of this page. So the fictional bad guys don't actually suffer from unrealistic inaccuracy; rather, the heroes' fictional performance would count as Improbable Aiming Skills in real life.\\nDodge the Bullet is the inverse of this. For the bladed weapon variation, see Never Bring a Knife to a Fist Fight. Opposite number to Improbable Aiming Skills. The use of More Dakka can either overcome this, or make it even sillier. When the bullets don't just spray around the target, but consistently hit where the target was a moment ago, it's a case of Hero-Tracking Failure. See also Plot Armor for the reason the bad guys are such lousy shots. When the enemies vastly outnumber the heroes, their incompetence is a symptom of Conservation of Ninjutsu.

Maybe the Grumpy Old Man is especially grumpy with having to spend the upcoming Christmas alone again this year. Maybe the Shell-Shocked Senior has decided that he can't live with what happened anymore.\\nThis is when a character has his or her personal Darkest Hour (or are just down in a slump) and is brought out of it by the people who truly matter. It could be that the villain's Evil Gloating is interrupted by the Big Damn Heroes delivering a bone shattering punch to the jaw and rousing the hero with a motivational speech, assuring him that his struggle isn't meaningless and that he has inspired people to greatness.

The temple had been left fallow for all that time, and the traveler who rediscovered them suggested them as good locations for revolutionaries to put up a base. When they left, during the Star Wars Expanded Universe, the Imperials ransacked the base and then abandoned it themselves. In the Jedi Academy Trilogy, Luke Skywalker decides to put his Jedi academy there, thoroughly averting this trope.\\n Background info in Star Wars: The Old Republic (which visits Yavin IV briefly in its \\\"Shadow of Revan\\\" arc) suggests that every so often, some enterprising-but-foolish smuggler or pirate heads to Yavin to lay low, is thoroughly freaked out and/or driven insane by the spirit of Exar Kun which haunts the temples. After nearly 5000 years of this status quo, it's no wonder nobody drops in for a casual visit.",
      "general": "In most fictional works, it's normal for an abandoned place to be left undisturbed until the protagonists need to utilize it. Sure, there might be a layer of dust everywhere, but the building can sit around for decades without anyone claiming it, renovating it, or outright demolishing it. If The Voice instructs the heroes to find an Abandoned Warehouse from fifty years ago, they can rest easy knowing that it'll still be there \\u2014 just break the lock, clear out the cobwebs, and continue advancing the plot.\\nMay be justified if the location is haunted.\\nHow much of this is Truth in Television varies widely. In highly-populated areas with thriving economies, this will almost never occur; if an Abandoned Hospital is sitting unused for any period of time, someone's going to exploit the local abandoned property laws to claim the land and build somethingnote\\u00A0 unless the cost of cleanup and demolition are exorbitant, even if that \\\"something\\\" is just a parking lot. On the other hand, structures in depressed economic areas, remote locations, or disaster zones can lie untouched for years, simply because no one is around (or wants to be around) to care. But even in places where buildings do stand vacant for long periods of time, they're rarely truly vacant. Squatters, trespassers, and the homeless will take up residence for a time, usually being driven off at semi-regular intervals by the local authorities. And there's always stray dogs/cats, raccoons, and other wild animals.\\nA notable variation is having an abandoned room inside a frequently-used building. This one tends to be more fanciful than factual, as any reasonable custodial staff would have access to blueprints and schematics showing where everything is. For a room to remain undisturbed for decades would normally require someone (or something...) actively protecting it.\\nNote that this trope refers to abandoned areas that are untouched for long periods of time. Areas that are allowed to decay but are still frequented by the homeless, criminals, or local kids don't count.\\nAbandoned Warehouse, Abandoned Hospital, Haunted House, and Ghost City are popular subjects for this trope.

Sure, Baron Bloodlust could kill them where they stand if he decided to, but you wouldn't know that from the insults. This is done when a defeated character laughs or snarks at the one who beat them, often when they're in no position to do so, possibly broken in pain on the floor or behind bars.

From the days of radio, banging two coconut halves together was the standard way to generate the sound effect of horse-hooves. Anyone who has ever actually been around a horse knows that horse-hooves rarely sound like this unless they're on a hard surface like concrete or pavement. All the same, the sound became so ingrained in the public consciousness that even when it later became possible to insert much more realistic sound effects, the coconut sound effect was still used. The audience wouldn't accept horse hooves making a sound not generated by coconuts.\\nMany other Stock Sound Effects are prime examples:\\n The Audible Gleam made by a specular reflection or intense light.\\n Kinetic Clicking: So ubiquitous that mobile phones tend to add clicking sounds to buttons pressed on their touch screen. All geared machines tick, switches make a loud 'clack' when turning on or off, crossbows have to make either a mechanical \\\"klang\\\" or a neat \\\"tchak\\\" to be taken seriously, and of course all Guns and Land Mines Go Click.\\n Noisy Nature flapping sound effects for large birds taking wing (even owls, whose main advantage is that they don't make noise in flight), migratory Kookaburras, and roaring mountain lions for just a few examples.\\n The Audible Sharpness of a sword being drawn from a scabbard or a knife being waved around.\\n Noisy explosions in space.\\n Kung-Foley: The 'whump' of a person getting punched in the face, or the exaggerated smack of a boxing glove. note\\u00A0This is one of the reasons slapstick comedy got its name: The slapstick was two sticks that, when struck together, sounded more like a \\\"slap\\\" than an actual slap did. Real-life fistfights tend to be eerily silent, which obviously wouldn't be very dramatic or exciting (and more than a little creepy.) In sword duels, there is a loud, echoing clash of metal when, in reality, swords just make a small 'tink' sound.

Even a moped will make V8 Engine Noises.\\n Beeping Computers and Pac Man Fever cover the standard sounds of modern technology and interactive entertainment.\\nThis trope does not apply exclusively to sound, but to any instance of an element that is used simply because the audience, consciously or unconsciously, expects it to be included, and/or because Stock Visual Metaphors allow writers to avoid long expositions via Show, Don't Tell:\\n Mainframe hackers had \\\"green lightning\\\" (or \\\"compatibility logic\\\" when the suits were around) named after an Ascended Glitch in an IBM terminal monitor left in so people would think the computer was \\\"doing something\\\".\\n Every cockpit must have Billions of Buttons.\\n Lens Flares are everywhere.\\n Technicolor Science: All chemicals are brightly colored note\\u00A0in reality most chemicals range from clear to a milky grey-brown, only a handful of common laboratory chemicals have any sort of color at all. Intense color is rare, found only in certain crystals, organometallic compounds, complex organic molecules, and metallic oxides. This is why wars were fought over control of things like indigo flowers and lapis lazuli before the invention of synthetic pigments.\\n Radiation always has a Sickly Green Glow note\\u00A0In real life most radioactive materials just look like any other metal (because radiation, by itself, is completely invisible). Some highly radioactive materials, when underwater or wet, will release blue light due to Cherenkov radiation however.\\n Every explosion will be accompanied by Impressive Pyrotechnics, and Every Car Is a Pinto.\\n People freezing or popping in space.\\nThis trope has a sister trope in the Rule of Perception, which explains why one would bother with any of these effects at all.\\nThe color version of this trope is Stock Object Colors.\\nSee also Reality Is Unrealistic, Mickey Mousing, Radio Voice, Vinyl Shatters, and the semi-related Extreme Graphical Representation.

Written well, this is a great way to pull off a Debut Queue, introducing the cast while establishing the Hero's magnet credentials. Written badly, you might find yourself wondering why the One Man Party hero spends so much time and energy trying to get the help of people who cannot or will not help themselves.\\nThis trope has long been a staple of the Role-Playing Game and Action Platformer genres, as well as games in other genres where team-based gameplay is mixed with a narrative. For the action platformers in particular, it's a bit of a tradition that you'll have to complete some challenge with the characters you have to acquire new characters.\\nCompare Sealed Cast in a Multipack, Avengers Assemble, Magnetic Hero.\\nContrast Defeat Means Friendship and Defeat Means Playable, which are roughly the opposite of this trope (although there are some occasions where they overlap) as well as Recruited From The Gutter (where the act of taking someone into a group saves them)."

      "general": "In science fiction movies and TV, asteroids form a vast, hyperkinetic, obstacle-strewn Death Course: Enormous rocks spin like tops and whiz around all over the place, frequently even smashing into each other. Trying to navigate one is like asking a chicken to cross a busy Los Angeles freeway during rush hour: Small nimble spacecraft flown by skillful Ace Pilots (i.e, the protagonists) may be able to slalom through without getting reduced to space dust, but any pursuing enemy fighter ships will get picked off one-by-one by giant, malevolent space boulders. Any capital ship who can't just blast a path through them with its Wave Motion Gun will have to rely on their Deflector Shields to bounce the rocks off.\\nIt's unfortunate that Real Life asteroid fields, while they do exist, don't have such a flair for the dramatic. Real Life asteroids are strewn much farther apart from each other; so far that the chance of even seeing one (let alone crashing into one) is pretty much nil. This is because a truly violent asteroid thicket, in Real Life, would simply dash itself to bits in a short period of time. Also, due to gravity, even dust will be attracted to itself; close rocks will probably merge, rather than crash together. Scientists have sent space probes through our solar system's main asteroid belt for decades, and haven't lost a single one in the process. While obviously no first-hand data is available about asteroid fields in other star systems, everything we know about physics tells us that they'd probably differ little from the ones in our own solar system and would be nothing like typical sci-fi depictions.\\nConversely, planetary rings are (relatively) much more sparse in fiction than real life \\u2014 dense. Voyager 2 flew through Saturn's G ring \\u2014 one of the fainter rings \\u2014 once, at an angle, and there was \\\"lots of evidence of micrometeroid hits\\\" on the quite small 4-meter diameter probe, and the Cassini spacecraft has used its antenna as shield when crossing the same ring during their mission at Saturn.

It fails miserably.",
      "general": "Are you a government official or similar authority who needs a quick, mundane excuse for a large number of mysterious, possibly supernatural deaths? Gas leaks are the way to go. They're accidental (no need to find a scapegoat!) and provide a good reason to keep people away from the site of the disaster (there might be lingering traces of gas there, after all!). You can even say that the gas was hallucinogenic, so that if any survivors or bystanders saw anything weird, well, that's why. And as a very last resort, it leaves you with a plausible explanation for the whole site conveniently exploding.\\nThe general populace will always swallow this one hook, line, and sinker, no matter how many times you use it or how implausible it is (maybe it's just that they're more comfortable believing in gas leaks than in demon attacks or the like).

Even though this character is better skilled, faster and more experienced than The Protagonist, they aren't The Hero, either because they are not The Chosen One or because they have already grown too old for the task. Their role is to introduce a new skill or sharpen the current skills of the protagonist, often hoping to pass the torch because they know their career is coming to an end. Expect him to have a very calm attitude as if he has wisdom that he will give out in his own due time.\\nThis character will almost always die so that the protagonist can learn to stand on his own two feet. Their death will also be a great motivator as it gives the protagonists a chance for vengeance. Afterwards, they'll usually become a Spirit Advisor, either as a literal \\\"spirit\\\" or in flashbacks.

It's been said that if you miss the first 15 minutes of a movie, you're not missing anything, as the plot doesn't pick up until later anyway. Many writers are aware of this, and their way of dealing with it is sometimes to do an Action Prologue.\\nAn Action Prologue starts off with something exciting happening immediately. Right at the beginning, the hero is sneaking around an enemy base, being menaced by a threat, or something similarly exciting. In some cases this is foreshadowing. The event may be a minor one, but related to a major plot point that we don't discover until much later. It could be a dream sequence, where the hero sees something threatening that later shows up for real. It could be the Establishing Character Moment for our badass Action Hero. Or it could be something completely unrelated to the main plot at all, used only to make sure that something exciting happens right at the start.\\nIn any case, the action quickly falls right after the Action Prologue, and then those usual first 15 minutes used to flesh out the story and introduce the characters show up. Often overlaps with How We Got Here when it shows off an action-packed scene from the end of the story before jumping to an earlier point in time to explain how the characters ended up in that scenario. War Was Beginning is a specific subtrope.\\nCompare Batman Cold Open, which illustrates a character's skills at the beginning of a story; and Danger Room Cold Open, which demonstrates the skills of a team. Contrast Prolonged Prologue, which is what happens when you drag it out too much, as well as It Gets Better where the work slaps you from the start with exposition... and more exposition... and still more exposition... It can happen that the Action Prologue is cut short and revealed not to have been really happening; that's a Fake Action Prologue.\\nA form of The Teaser, often In Medias Res. Also known as a Bond Opening Sequence, since James Bond uses it so much.

Thus he can be considerably younger than the average Retired Badass.\\nThe classic plotline for a Retired Gunfighter is for a Young Gun or The Gunfighter Wannabe to try to force him out of retirement for one last gunfight so they can make a reputation. Alternatively, an old enemy or a surviving relative of an old enemy arrives to seek Revenge.\\nFrequently, a retired gunslinger will have changed his name or otherwise obscured his identity in order to avoid his reputation.

He can also simply be a surprise hero, masquerading as a Meek Townsman until the villain shows up. Often his family and friends are surprised as they didn't know he was a gunfighter.

We may blame others even when we know deep down in our hearts that it is our fault. Due to the Rule of Drama, fictional characters will blame themselves for things going south most of the time, but there are some cases where, just like in Real Life, the character who really is to blame will blame everyone else instead. Common variations include:\\n The person stuck with the blame fails to defend himself, perhaps out of sheer dumbfoundedness at the other person's gall.\\n The blame-shifter offers an absurdly flimsy pretext for ducking responsibility.\\n The character does this all the time... and consistently gets away with it.\\nThis is a frequent component of Comedic Sociopathy and Revenge Myopia. Also tends to involve Psychological Projection and Moral Dissonance. The diametric opposite of It's All My Fault. A character prone to this will likely try Glad I Thought of It too. Compare Hypocritical Humor, which can involve a similar blindness to one's own flaws, and Implausible Deniability. See also It's All About Me and Narcissist, which are key reasons why a character would fall into any of the above.

This can range from positioning the camera to only show small portions of the object to cloaking the object in heavy rain, fog, smoke or shadow. That way, the audience can get a good idea of what is on-screen without the effects budget being depleted. Furthermore, when the time comes to show the asset fully, the team will have conserved their money for that crucial shot.\\nThis can be a double-edged sword. Done properly, the concealed special effects can build suspense and mystique around the portrayed object while keeping on budget. Done poorly, this can work a lot like the Streisand Effect, in that the concealment can call attention to the fact that the effects aren't up to snuff.\\nSometimes this approach is executed intentionally for artistic reasons. Budget may not be the issue, but audience expectations and prejudices may be, especially when it comes to certain genres. This may be a drama story which just happens to include fantastic elements that the creator wishes to minimize, at least onscreen. As a result, the focus remains on the acting, characters, and story. It also serves to avoid having the film or show be categorized as just another science fiction or fantasy, genres that many viewers and critics view negatively. This approach is often found in Fantastic Romance, frequently those involving time travel.\\nSee also Nothing Is Scarier (a trope that shows how using this in horror works especially well).

There may be no actual government in this Wild West or Scavenger World because it is miles or light years away from civilization, and if there is it's probably a Dystopia that's corrupt, incompetent, obstructive or perhaps just uncaring enough to not bother to spread its reach to all corners of society. If this hive has any truly good authorities, expect them to be extremely overworked, incapable of controlling the skyrocketing crime everywhere, or just too idealistic to survive. An alternative is to have it as a gang-like system ruled by a mob boss, Big Bad or Evil Overlord who allows evil, but only to a certain standard. It could be truly lawless with no authority other than the big stick you carry with you.\\nThe economy is often no better. Public facilities are usually falling apart, and the subways and buses are often full of crooks and junkies. And they're always late. Any schools in this place will almost inevitably be impoverished or sadistic. The roads may be cracked and broken, with a Trashcan Bonfire ever fifty feet or so. Many buildings have been abandoned, to be occupied by vermin, hobos, or criminals. Decent jobs are few and far between. Housing (if you can get it) is unsafe, filthy, and overcrowded. In short, poverty is the norm, not the exception.\\nThis lawless setting is often wonderful for allowing all varieties of creativity, ideas and/or tropes to flow in, be played and interact in interesting ways, and many plot conveniences that the protagonists need to get away with doing active work rather than just handing problems over to the police or running into Fridge Logic when they don't get arrested for taking the law into their own hands, while there are several takes on all sorts of unlawful or devious acts.

The tenuous peace is only held together by The Bartender and his Bouncers. Bar room brawls and aggressive drunks optional.\\n The City NarrowsThe back alley to the entire town; a small section of a city that has a bad name for a good reason and gets avoided by decent folk with any sense.\\n Red Light DistrictA street, block, or even complete district of a city devoted to prostitution and other illicit trades.\\n Outlaw TownA settlement run by criminals, for the benefit of criminals.\\n Not-So-Safe HarborA port, harbour or coastal town that has fallen into wretchedness due to the flux of sailors and pirates and the sort of rough entertainment they desire.\\n Vice CityAn entire urban sprawl that has fallen to wretchedness including its authorities which provide little sense of escape but also little constraint.

The key to not letting this trope kill you in real life is to keep in mind that if you are saying \\\"it's probably nothing,\\\" something has made you say that, and further investigation (or in the case of a disaster, just getting the hell out of there and/or obeying the warnings) might be an inconvenience that proves it was nothing after all, or it might save your life.\\n\\nExamples"

Needless to say, such a setting is easy pickings for Author Tracts and Strawman Political characters.\\nThis trope can be either played straight or subverted. When played straight, the Perfect Pacifist People will be Actual Pacifists, shunning all physical violence even when their society is threatened. In these cases, a common plot point is for a character to learn the ways of war (so he can teach it to his people), or find others to do the fighting for them.\\nSubversions happen when the pacifist utopia isn't perfect. Perhaps they're pacifists in name only who have no qualms fighting outsiders, or it's a fa\\u00E7ade for the elites, with lesser citizens relegated to a Dystopia Beneath the Earth. Or perhaps they preach and (non-violently) enforce pacifism at the price of any individuality whatsoever. Or, if they aren't planning on blaming human nature and ending free will, they'll try to enforce the peace through fear of the law, and seek to make other people subservient to that law by suppressing their actions, without holding any value for the lives of others; they'd likely be the type to condemn emotion as a weakness, failing to perceive or comprehend any meaning within another person's life.\\nIt's worth noting that the utopian society described in Plato's The Republic both subverts this trope and plays it straight. The Republic has a general pacifist attitude, but its citizens are ready to fight if necessary; on the other hand, it's not above hiring mercenaries from its neighbours as well, both to defend the Republic and to weed out their most violent members.\\nAlso see Rousseau Was Right (which believes that such a future is inevitable), Crystal Spires and Togas, No Poverty and Mary Suetopia.

In some cases this can even go as far as a book based on the film of the book (distinct from just re-releasing the original novel with a film poster slapped on the cover).\\nAt best, the novelization is a faithful rendition of the film's story that takes additional time to explore and explain things the movie didn't have time to do itself (like the inner motivations of the characters, or justification for certain plot holes); at worst, you end up with something that reads like someone copied the film script and added \\\"It Was a Dark and Stormy Night\\\" at the top.\\nNovelizations are also often put together quickly, using an early draft of the film's script so that the author can finish the writing and have the book published to tie in with the movie's theatrical release; this incurs a very real risk that the copy of the script the author was working from may differ substantially from the final script used in filming (this happened with Chris Claremont's X2: X-Men United novelization, amongst many others). If the movie winds up having its release delayed, the book might be in something of a no man's land when it comes to sales, while the film itself is potentially spoiled by anyone who reads the novel (which happened to Penelope). On the other hand, sometimes the book is better than the movie, especially if the movie wasn't great in the first place.\\nMany of these novels are ghostwritten or with the authors writing under pen names, with some having written quite a few of them under a variety of different aliases.\\nThe novelization is not exclusive to film; episodes of popular television shows may be novelized as well (for example, almost all of the Doctor Who original series serials were novelized), as can Comic Book Story Arcs, and even video games (usually ones with strong narrative elements, like RPGs). These vary from Expanded Universe material to complete bastardizations that only bear the name of the original.\\nSee also Tie-In Novel."

Patients may be terrified by the way he acts and the bizarre treatments he puts them through, but when the doctor is done with them they're actually cured.\\nThis has happened often enough in Real Life that there's a branch of medical ethics devoted to figuring out what you can do to your patients For Science!, and (at least in the USA) every hospital and university has a committee whose entire job is to oversee research with human subjects.

You and your team have come up with a workable strategy for how to tackle a challenging opponent. It will require organization and good timing, but you're sure it will work if you get everything set up in advance... wait, did KillerMonkeyz548 just open fire? Congratulations, your brilliant plan has just been ruined in one move by a Leeroy Jenkins.\\nThe Leeroy Jenkins (or just Leeroy for short) is a specific type of Noob who has no patience for complicated plans, preferring to charge full-tilt into the fray and start attacking whatever's in front of him. Since this is a semi-viable strategy some of the time (depending on what game you're playing and the difficulty of the opposition), a Leeroy can remain undetected until the team hits the first real challenge, whereupon he gets everyone killed. Any attempts to point out that he had totally ignored the plan will be met with words to the effect of \\\"plans are stupid\\\". And he will never retreat.\\nOn the plus side, a Leeroy can sometimes be detected before they cause calamity when you see them utter (or type) words to the effect of \\\"Hey, watch this!\\\" In groups with experienced players, the phrase can be translated as \\\"Immediately stop moving toward those enemies with very big guns and back out of Alpha Strike range because Sir Badassboi is about to do something incredibly stupid and attention-grabbing.\\\" Never attempt to save a Leeroy from the consequences of his mad charge; this will only encourage him, as well as provide repeated amusement \\u2014 he will often attempt the exact same thing again when he's revived. Should the group somehow miraculously pull through, don't expect him to wait for you to recover; he's already charging the next target.\\nIf your leader doesn't wise up and punt him from the team after the first couple offenses, he can become a real-life gaming example of The Millstone; ruining any chance you have of completing your quest or mission successfully.\\nThe trope is named after a World of Warcraft video that has been made famous around the net. For more information, see Leeroy Jenkins Video.\\n\\\"Stop being such a Leeroy\\\" has become multiplayer jargon in the time since, and it's sometimes used as a verb \\\"to Leeroy\\\" meaning to act in this way. Ironically, the original staged video can be seen as sympathetic towards Leeroy in that it also mocks and parodies excessive planning in parties. Considering that many of the mistakes made by the group in their attempt to save Leeroy were part of the group's original plan, the implied point is that if you have a Leeroy Jenkins in your party, you probably deserve him. The exception is a Pick-Up Group... in which case you know what you're going to get.\\nIf an A.I. character that you need to keep alive does this, you have a classic example of a bad Escort Mission.\\nSome players also use \\\"pulling a Leeroy\\\" to refer to rushing in heedless of your own safety even when this is a viable tactic.\\nIf, rather than being a Noob, the Leeroy is doing this purposefully to get a laugh out of disrupting the Serious Business that internet gaming has become, then he is a Griefer and should be kicked.\\nCompare Attack! Attack! Attack!, The Real Man, Indy Ploy, and Strategy Schmategy. See also some Challenge Gamers. Not to be confused with avant-garde musician Leroy Jenkins or the sports columnist of the same name. For other similar character behaviors, see Reckless Sidekick, Unwitting Instigator of Doom, and Fearless Fool, as well as some incarnations of The Berserker. This type of character may have been inspired from living with a Martyrdom Culture, or trying to perform a Zerg Rush by yourself. Contrast We Need a Distraction and Crazy Enough to Work.

      "general": "If you've read Comic Books, then you know Death Is Cheap, Staying Alive is easy and there's a thousand ways to trump the Sorting Algorithm of Deadness.\\nThere are, however, some characters who stay dead. These are the loved ones who suffered Death by Origin Story, and play a vital role in the motivations of the hero. Their death can be (in)directly the hero's fault (Spider-Man, Uncle Ben), not their fault but still a huge motivation (Batman, Thomas and Martha Wayne) or simply there to add drama (Superman, Pa Kent). Similarly, Scars Are Forever when they represent an important event for a character (for instance, Barbara Gordon's lower body paralysis).\\nSure, bringing them back is always possible and could take the story in exciting new directions, and deeply change the Fallen Hero when his dead little sister returns... or it just might be in bad taste, get poorly handled, nullify their motivation and lead to a Retcon or Author's Saving Throw that \\\"they were really a robot Shapeshifting Alien clone... ninja\\\" and promptly getting killed or forgotten. This is why Status Quo Is God.\\nUsually, the rationale for why they can't be brought back involves a Fantastic Aesop about not meddling with death because of dire consequences... except the hero, villain, and a score of other popular characters have already cheated death with no major consequences.\\nUsually this happens because The Call Knows Where You Live. When the loved ones aren't specifically murdered by a villain, their deaths are often due to something common and/or vague such as a car accident or some kind of disease that shall not be named. The cause of death can also start out very vaguely and then clarify (often disastrously) as the story progresses.\\nA variation of Death by Origin Story occurs when the important death is the main protagonist's own death, as important part of his or her own origin story. Usually, this involves a transition to an undead state of some sort, or alternatively, the character dies but is resurrected in a new form and granted superpowers. Or, it can become a mystery where the hero has to find out Whodunnit to Me in order to either avoid death or avenge it.\\nWhen a series becomes popular enough, they might decide to make a prequel. The characters would still be alive at the time, but everyone knows they're Doomed by Canon and would watch it only to see how it happens if it wasn't shown already.\\nCompare Death by Newbery Medal, Last of His Kind, Dying to Be Replaced, Conveniently an Orphan, Plot-Triggering Death. If the death of a loved one causes a character to become a villain, instead, that's a variant of the Start of Darkness. Might result in Forgotten Fallen Friend.

As you sit there in your chains, how do you feel?\\nIf your answer is \\\"well, a little sad \\u2014 but who cares about that, it's escapin' time!\\\", you might be a fictional character. Angst? What angst?\\nThe polar opposite of Wangst, this is when a character has been given every reason to fall into depression or go Ax-Crazy, but... just doesn't, and life goes on. They aren't The Stoic or the Determinator; they aren't holding off their real feelings by an effort of will. Nor are they putting on a brave face because they can't endure pity. They're just sort of rolling with it, riding out the adventure as it comes and looking ahead to the next plot event.\\nThis trope appears frequently in children's media, particularly adventure stories featuring young heroes who never Freak Out when piloting a burning biplane into a T-Rex's gaping maw. These protagonists take everything in stride; if anything, they think it's all impossibly cool and wish it would never end. Real children would be forgiven if they burst into hysterics, but it isn't fun for real children to read about other kids screaming in terror as their lives fall apart. So fictional children don't. That said, it doesn't have to be an adventure story or a work specifically aimed at children; any genre with horrible suffering is a good environment to show off this trope (except the ones that thrive on the characters angsting, like soap operas).\\nThe Deconstructed version of this trope exposes the calm protagonist as a Stepford Smiler, showing nothing on the surface but breaking inside. It is also possible to combine this trope with the Law of Disproportionate Response, creating a character who overreacts to little things and underreacts to big things, all to show how mentally unstable s/he has become.\\nAs disliked as Wangst is, you'd think this would be preferable, but any trope can be mishandled. A character shrugging at trauma that would reduce a Real Life person to emotional collapse (or at least a few honest tears) can definitely strain the audience's Willing Suspension of Disbelief. A character who does not react to suffering can come across as a sociopath \\u2014 hardly what this trope is meant to express. Of course, similar to Wangst, this trope can be Played for Laughs as well.\\nPossibly Truth in Television for the more extreme cases. If you're fighting for your life, you don't have time to think about how awful it is \\u2014 not at that very second, anyway. Afterward, all bets are off.\\nCompare Plot-Powered Stamina, where characters shrug off physical (rather than emotional) trauma and stress like it's nothing."

Then, in that moment, both the cast and the audience are reminded that, if nothing else, the world itself is just...awesome.\\nExamples usually, though not always, involve being in the air, as this allows for the whole world to be shown. Or, you know, large parts of it. The characters will all be in awe, and the music will be either super-upbeat, serene and full of reverb, or not there at all. Expect the art work to suddenly take itself more seriously than usual.\\nBy looking at the character's expressions, you can tell that even they are impressed, so think how you should feel sitting there, watching/reading/playing this on your boring old earth. Expect comments like, \\\"Amazing!\\\" \\\"Awesome!\\\" \\\"I can't believe it!\\\" Also expect some lesser-awesome things to happen in the distance, like a sea serpent jumping out of the ocean, or a pack of dragon-wolves flying in the distance, or maybe a volcano erupting. In fact, all of the above will usually happen at the exact same time to make the world even more awesome. That, however, is mostly an introductory bonus, as the rest of the world will become \\\"dull and boring\\\" as the cast is Walking the Earth. All of these slightly-awesome happenings will happen only on and off at most and at specific moments.\\nThis can happen at any point of the series, though usually at the beginning as a hook for the audience. If used at the beginning, it's usually done to show that the cast is moving away from their normal life. If used some where in the middle of the series, it's usually done to show how far they have come, in which case the characters will probably get a I Can See My House from Here moment. If used at the end, it might either be used for the previous example, or to show how the entire world has changed. Almost always, this will lead to the characters suddenly realizing that they're about to fall, thus ending the beautiful moment.\\nFor Fantasy films with a romantic subplot, this is the moment when a boy takes a girl indifferent to him into a mindblower of an experience flying with the world's wonders in full view and realizing to her wonder what the boy can do. By the time they come in for a landing, the girl usually needs no more convincing that she is not letting this terrific guy go.\\nSometimes, the camera is simply showing off the world ahead of you. This trope only works if the character would otherwise be amazed at the brave new world he has stepped into. If the character(s) is(are) otherwise not amazed, as the world would seem pretty boring to them, this trope doesn't work, though this usually happens at the very, very beginning since the setting has yet to be described.\\nSometimes these moments happen during gameplay where you do something extra-awesome for the very first time. See also That's No Moon! though that usually consists of fear, and The Ruins I Caused for when characters are looking down at something that's been destroyed. They Should Have Sent A Poet is an alternate name for this trope, and describes a common reaction to such an experience.\\nThe Trope Namer is the Discovery Channel, which occasionally uses the titular phrase as a tagline.\\nSee also Scenery Porn and Visual Effects of Awesome (may indeed be considered the cinematographer/animator/special effects crew's Moment Of Awesome).

It often happens to highly hyped products, products made by big-name developers, or products that are part of a Cash Cow Franchise or tie into something already currently successful.\\nIt can also apply to any product that is rushed for release by a certain date, or in time for a certain event (such as the deadline for an award nomination or convention appearance). Whatever the case, the fact that the product was rushed often leads to a poorly made product. The Problem with Licensed Games and Porting Disaster usually occurs due to this, as the developers are rushed to have the game released at the same time as the licensed property's premiere/launch/kickoff.\\nThis can often lead to Development Hell. Worse are those products that do manage to be released on time, since it's often obvious that they're rush jobs. On the other hand, if the work is an Ashcan Copy, literally everything is subordinate to getting the thing out quickly and cheaply in order to retain the rights."

It may also be subject to a type of a Magic Countdown; no matter how much time the heroes take, the walls are just far enough for them to escape, even moving back between shots.\\nCommon ways for heroes to escape this vicious trap is to find a means to brace the moving walls, wait for their Sidekick to find a way inside and get them out Just in Time before the walls (or spiked walls) would have surely crushed them, or a combination of the two.\\nOnly in horror movies is it relatively common for characters to get caught in these traps and fail to make it out in time.\\nThis was commonly used as a stock Cliffhanger in Film Serials of the 1940s, and has appeared frequently in such works.

      "ANewHope": "Star Wars (the original 1977 film) got Oscar nominations for Best Director, Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (for Sir Alec Guinness) and Best Screenplay. It didn't win any of them, of course, but still. Raiders of the Lost Ark also managed to get nominations for Best Director and Best Picture.\\n Same for ET The Extra Terrestrial.\\n Likewise, 2010's ceremony saw best picture nominations for sci-fi films Avatar and District 9. Both were nominated, without winning, in other major categories: the former was nominated for directing, the latter for adapted screenplay. On the other hand, the Star Trek franchise got its first Oscar, for makeup. It only took eleven films and 30 yearsnote\\u00A0Of course, it doesn't help that almost half of those movies were generally agreed to be awful, not just by Academy standards, but by the standards of people predisposed to like science fiction in general and Star Trek in particular.",
      "general": "You would think that a good movie is a good movie, and that good movies just get Oscars, wouldn't you?\\nUnfortunately, it isn't so. Because Oscars get people to the theater, and because ticket sales increase a studio's bottom line, movie studios and producers have come up with many schemes to get Oscars for their films. Nevertheless, for a long time, the kinds of movies that won Oscars were enjoyed by both the public and the critics, though not all of them have aged well. Often, bigger was better for budgets and box-office receipts.\\nBut the prime years of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, in tandem with the crumbling \\\"New Hollywood\\\" of the 1960s-70s, caused a schism to emerge. Studios started targeting the common man more often with the rise of the Summer Blockbuster. While Spielberg and Lucas's best works were beloved and received many nominations and awards, their perceived \\\"lightweight\\\" nature kept them from winning in \\\"important\\\" categories (acting, direction, writing, picture). On the other side of the coin, audiences became less interested in the weightier fare that did win in those categories; that \\\"serious\\\" fare that has become Oscar Bait.\\nOscar Bait is usually a depressing drama because True Art Is Angsty, or some inspiring true story. Comedy has had a hard time at the Oscars from the beginning; this is one reason Tom Hanks Syndrome exists. Other genres doing hard are western, sci-fi and fantasy. If it deals with some form of mental illness or an example of man's inhumanity to man (as noted, The Holocaust is a big draw here, particularly in the Nineties' Oscar selection, and still fairly reliable), then so much the better. Animation? Pre-2001, forget it, but post-2001, every promising animated feature film has a chance... at their own category (with a few exceptions making their way into Best Picture)\\nThey aren't all gloom and doom. A heartwarming, inspirational drama or Dramedy or even a Dark Comedy film can easily be positioned as Oscar Bait because there's still room for suffering. If your movie is science fiction or fantasy, however, you might as well not bother; these types of movies usually get the technical awards such as Visual Effects, but not much else.\\nThe act of setting out to create a movie with the explicit intention to cleaning up at the Academy Awards is known as \\\"Oscarbation.\\\" Making your movie Oscar Bait is a great way to attract Hype Aversion and especially Hype Backlash: people might be turned off by the over-hype your movie receives and, if they get around to watching it, may not be as impressed by the result as the awards panel was. Deader Than Disco, as noted at that trope entry, may well follow - especially if your movie comes out empty-handed or only picks up technical awards.\\nIndeed, many of these movies have not done well at the box-office. The diminishing ratings of Oscar telecasts may be related to the dislike the casual viewing public has for the average Oscar-nominated film. Some have argued that it's time the voters started getting back in line with \\\"popular tastes\\\" (though there are nominees and winners that are blockbusters). But the people who do the nominations are unlikely to change their criteria, so the status quo continues. In extreme cases, this can lead to an Award Snub: movies widely accepted to be genuinely deserving but don't appear to tick the correct boxes are overlooked in favor of less-deserving fare which does.\\nIt's worth noting that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that starting with the 2010 ceremony (honoring the films of 2009) the Best Picture category would be expanded to include ten nominees instead of the long-traditional five. This Roger Ebert piece wonders if successful films that don't conform to Oscar Bait will find a place at the table again this way. This appears to have come true, as the 2010 ceremony's best picture category included the likes of Avatar, District 9, Inglourious Basterds and Up. However, the winner was a war drama that not many people saw (being an arthouse limited release in the middle of the summer and all). In 2011, the winner was The King's Speech \\u2014a historical biopic about a soon to be king struggling against a speech impediment\\u2014 winning for Best Picture and Best Director, which subsequently did very good sustained box office business with the general public.\\nIt's also worth noting Best Picture winners like The Departed, The Lord of the Rings and No Country for Old Men, along with the large number of depressing historical dramas (read: Oscar Bait) that don't win. The Academy may be able to detect more blatant bait. The fact that Tropes Are Not Bad should also be noted, and the fact that a film is Oscar bait does not necessarily mean it is poor or even pretentious \\u2014 Forrest Gump, for instance, swept the awards, and is also widely adored, as did The Pianist, which, whilst not necessarily \\\"enjoyed\\\" is often considered a film everyone should watch, especially in Europe. In fact, European audiences tend to be more receptive to Oscar Bait than American ones, partly because it is one of the few ways that European films can compete in America and partly because European cinema is more into weighty dramas than American, largely because European studios don't have budgets larger than the GDP of small African nations, so such films are easier for them to produce.\\nThis can also happen on TV as Emmy Bait, or on Broadway as Tony Bait.\\nCompare Death by Newbery Medal. See also Award Bait Song. Not something to lure Soviet SSGNs. Also compare Award Snub where films deserving an Oscar don't get one. Contrast Summer Blockbuster, Dump Months."

The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster's Achilles' Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart's content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes even apparent mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.\\nWithout stopping to breathe, apparently.\\nThis has become less common in the era of Decompressed Comics, possibly because it was taken to silly degrees at times, but has never really gone away.\\nThis is mostly found in comics and Web Comics, as it compares time to talk with time to do. If a comic is translated to a medium where time is a factor, then this can become obvious. A slightly less unbelievable example is often found when Calling Your Attacks. However, those also have a tendency to become Free Actions, particularly with those with long names and explanations attached.\\nAnime versions of Manga, for example, sometimes end up having Midstrike Monologues, where it almost seems like Time Stands Still for the purpose of attacks, but not for the hero to deliver an In the Name of the Moon speech. Character Filibuster can also be another, albeit less extreme, version of Monologing Is A Free Action.\\nAnother variant can occur in roleplaying Video games, where battle can stop for dialogue scenes, either for Character Development or rules description. Sometimes this is with enemies present, but refusing to attack. Maybe they're caught up in the romance or wonder of the moment. Or maybe they realise they're doomed cannon fodder and think it best to savour their last moments of life.\\nThe Trope Namer is Dungeons & Dragons, in which certain actions (most notably talking) are designated \\\"free actions\\\" and can be taken in addition to any other actions within the normal limit of a turn. Talking does not distract the player from any other actions and there is no word count limit on how much the player can say. This is a case of Rule of Fun - spouting a Bond One-Liner during combat is awesome but no one would do it when it would impair combat performance.\\nCompare Inaction Sequence, Comic-Book Time, Webcomic Time, Expolabel, Wall of Text. Compare Changing Clothes Is a Free Action or Transformation Is a Free Action for the apparel equivalent. Talk to the Fist is this trope's feared enemy, and Killed Mid-Sentence is the biggest subversion/aversion. Contrast Distracting Disambiguation, where there is some amount of cooperation on the enemies' part that enables this, and Holding the Floor, where a character talks to deliberately buy time. See also Exposition Beam, which bypasses this. And see Magic Countdown, which can be an example of this if the characters are talking during an artificially slow countdown.

Owen may not have been telling Luke the truth about that, however, much like he was lying to Luke about the fate of his father in order to keep him sheltered. (The hologram of Leia probably made him decide against mentioning that he knew where the droids had come from.)

Even then, the goal is not specifically to destroy the lock, but to destroy the surrounding door or the hinges. The old standby \\\"entry tool\\\" (a small battering ram) is a better choice in most situations; the reason breaching shotguns exist at all is that a battering ram requires at least two people to operate, and the shotgun can be used to shoot bad guys too.

Normally, the writers figure out what the relationship between two people should be in a series, then they take the stock derivatives and toss in cues to clue the viewer into how things are between those two people. When this trope crops up, however, it's usually the result of a writer breaking from the established relationship types and attempting to forge unusual bonds.

Regardless of how it happened, they managed to pull off a Relationship Writing Fumble and now the writers are stuck dealing with the consequences. In minor cases, it will just be popular Fanon, but sometimes you'll have entire fanbases assuming that's what the writer \\\"really\\\" intended.\\nThe best ways to spot these fall into two groups \\u2014 Word of God meddling and series dissonance:\\n The Word of God comes out to explain how things really are.\\n The relationship gets Strangled by the Red String.\\n The relationship is reworked to either concede or prohibit the unintended consequences in an Ultimate Universe.\\n The scenes and dialog in question are overdubbed, excised, or retconned.\\n Ho Yay or Unfortunate Implications in a G-Rated series.\\n One or both of the characters in question is Master of the Mixed Message.\\nThis is highly subjective, of course.

It's almost as if they were made of sawdust instead of flesh.\\nA subvariety of this trope allows for a small amount of blood, looking more like a ketchup stain from a particularly sloppy lunch, to mark the location of a wound. This will sometimes lead to such absurdities as a character with a cut lip conspicuously dribbling blood, while another character who is shot to death is shown with his/her wounds bone-dry!\\nThis was a common trope in Action Series, Adventure Series, and Crime and Punishment Series until recently; for various reasons of taste and censorship, blood was never shown no matter how thoroughly perforated the victim was. Of late, though, shows like CSI and Law & Order have begun to be more explicit/realistic about just how messy most violent deaths are.\\nFantasy and some historical works, similarly, will not show blood even when someone is stabbed or cut. In some examples (particularly shows geared towards younger audiences), swords and other bladed weapons will seemingly only be used to clash against each other, and never be shown to draw blood. Two swordsmen will exchange blows for several seconds, but the telling blow will be a kick or shoulder block to knock the opponent down. Scenes of the aftermath of a battle will show broken or dropped weapons, discarded shields, fallen banners, dozens of arrows, and the occasional helmet or three, but never any bodies.\\nA second, somewhat more humorous variation is to depict a relatively harmless conflict or game, such as Dodgeball, Paintball matches, or Water gun fights, as if it were a real war or slaughter. Complete with dramatic slow-motion scenes, over-acted last words, and splashes of paint or water where blood would spray.\\nMay be justified in a science fiction setting using Energy Weapons, although it's a common misconception that the massive heat produced by the beam would instantly cauterize the wound before it had a chance to bleed.

While a laser in a movie may just knock over people with little signs of blood or burning, it's best not to dwell too much on what the wounds from such a weapon would really look like...\\nSee also Pretty Little Headshots and As Lethal as It Needs to Be.\\nContrast High-Pressure Blood when the amount of blood is unrealistic by being excessive.

Invariably, mere minutes into the mission, they've all been ambushed and killed off by the platoon-load, leaving only the hero alive to finish the job.\\nHappens all the time in action shows; so often, in fact, that it makes one wonder how these guys ever passed muster (heck, even survived long enough) for assignment to an elite military or security force if they drop like mayflies in every tactical situation.\\nThis often massive loss of life will rarely be noted by anyone or have any direct effect on the plot, unless the heroes need to emote over how senseless the situation is. These guys are spear carriers in the finest Joseph Campbell tradition.\\nProvides a convenient demonstration of just how scary the villain is and also explains why the villain gets away all the time (at least at the time).\\nThis is sometimes justified by the idea that the doomed Red Shirts are actually quite competent, especially in other areas, but they've never had any formal training in how to fight beings that can kill them simply if you look at them funny. In other words, take The Worf Effect and apply it to an entire military.\\nThis Trope is actually very inaccurate when you compare it to Real Life. If you were to watch every episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, count the number of casualties that the Enterprise had, and then compare that to an actual military, you'd see that Kirk's record as a leader in this regard is excellent, far better than any general in U.S. history. Even war heroes like George Washington and Dwight D. Eisenhower had proportionately more casualties among their troops.note\\u00A0Before you take this line of thought too far, it should be noted that Washington and Eisenhower were in command during actual wars; it would be more appropriate to compare Kirk's casualty rate of to units on exploratory, rather than combat, missions.\\nAs the singular Red Shirt is the \\\"good\\\" counterpart to Evil Minions, the Redshirt Army is the \\\"good\\\" counterpart to the endless hordes of Mooks. The Badass Army is the logical opposite to this; take note how often (as in the example above) Red Shirt Army is, in fact, a subversion of Badass Army via The Worf Effect. Another opposite are the Men of Sherwood, who aren't quite badass enough to qualify as a Badass Army, but who are at least competent enough at their jobs not to be wiped out on the spot.\\nOften precedes Lowered Monster Difficulty.\\nSee Also: A-Team Firing, Cannon Fodder, Conservation of Ninjutsu, Curb-Stomp Battle, Lemming Cops\\nAlso: A Red Shirt that has, through luck, moxie, or through the endearment of the fanbase may become a Mauve Shirt...clothed in the most powerful of Plot Armor. The Mauve Shirt will often accompany the army as their leader or representative...and generally makes it out alive.

Dulcinea is the name Don Quixote gives to the (blissfully unaware) noblewomannote\\u00A0Actually just a peasant called Aldonza of whom he is the self-appointed champion, ready to quest for her honor and die for her name. (He read too many books on chivalry, you see.) In the Spanish of the time, \\\"Dulcinea\\\" is an overly elegant way to say \\\"sweetness,\\\" and the name persists as code for the object of one's hopeless devotion and idealized love.\\nThe Knight In Shining Armour (in non-medieval settings, The Cape) is a frequent user of this trope. Medieval chivalric romances, indeed, portrayed knights who fell in love with a princesse lointaine (faraway princess) merely on hearing her described.\\nThe Dulcinea Effect is often used to hook a hero into the story or steer him in a particular plot direction. Championing the Distressed Damsel is often an excuse for the hero to become involved in righting a larger injustice or confronting the Big Bad or foiling the Evil Plan when he otherwise might have simply walked away. Sometimes his devotion to her is a transparent excuse to justify his usual habit of traveling In Harm's Way. By application of the effect, the Distressed Damsel usually becomes the protagonist's Love Interest.\\nThis is not to say that the motivation involved is solely (or even partially) out of lust or love. In championing the girl involved, the hero may have no other motivation than acting in support of an ideal, particularly in Romantic Era examples and those inspired by it. This trope is, after all, Older Than Print. The Failure Knight may be motivated by a desire to atone and Big Brother Instinct is possible if the Dulcinea is much younger than him.\\nAdditionally, heroes under The Dulcinea Effect in more cynical settings (particularly Film Noir) tend to fall prey to a Wounded Gazelle Gambit set up by a Femme Fatale or The Vamp, who generally know about this effect and take advantage of it in the most evil way possible.\\nSeldom gets Gender Flip; after all, Men Are the Expendable Gender but it happens nonetheless.\\nThe Dulcinea Effect is also the main reason that women are put into a fridge in order to cause the male character angst and push him to drive the plot forward. Contrast Magnetic Hero, for a hero's ability to pull this on followers. Chronic Hero Syndrome is when the hero does this for any random stranger. If this leads to a highly implausible romance, it's a case of Strangled by the Red String. See also Living MacGuffin. It's quite possibly related to Love Makes You Dumb.\\nIf the woman has little to no personality and this is her only purpose in the plot, it's a variant of Excuse Plot.\\n\\nExamples"

For storytelling reasons the operation may not be called genocide or otherwise be made to sound bad. There are three basic ways in which this can play:\\n Admit it proudly, and inflate the figures. It wasn't just necessary, it was right. The demographic/species you exterminated were Always Chaotic Evil, and anyway A Million Is a Statistic. You might want to put narrative focus on how much better off all non-bad/normal/good people are now that the bad/weird/evil people are no longer around to contaminate and/or prey upon them. The only sad thing about any of it is how many non-bad/normal/good people suffered and died exterminating them. There's room for fudging the figures, but only upward - to make your extermination-achievement look greater, and your losses greater and/or more tragic as well.\\n Avoid admitting it, and down-scale the figures. Maybe it wasn't 'right', but it was necessary. The demographic/species you dealt with were quite definitely Always Chaotic Evil, and it was all their fault anyway - it was you or them! Your own lot suffered so much more than they did that you can't even imagine how offensive it would be to suggest that they came off worse just because you dealt with them all!\\n Genocide of who...? You never killed anyone, let alone these... what did you say they were they called again? That whole time period you're so concerned about was very fuzzy - badly-documented, lots of records lost. It was a time of great unrest and upheaval. Even if they had been a real people, anything could've happened to those guys. Just because this hypothetical demographic isn't around today doesn't mean someone killed them all - that's a very serious accusation! Where's your evidence? ...oh, I see. Have You Told Anyone Else? No? Well, nice knowing you. Can't very well start having a conscience now...\\nThe option to be offended is an interesting one.\\nCompare Villain with Good Publicity, Devil in Plain Sight, Blackmail Is Such an Ugly Word, No, Except Yes, and Metaphorically True."

At least one creative writing course views such bleak moments as essential to effective plotting.\\nThis usually precedes a Day of Reckoning climax where only a few things can happen:\\n The Big Damn Heroes moment, where either your characters will make a comeback or someone else arrives to help.\\n There's a spot of hope that is then cruelly crushed, which leads to a Downer Ending or a Bittersweet Ending.\\n The author is ultimately going for a happy ending, but is feeling cruel enough to add a Hope Spot anyway before the heroes emerge from the mire.\\nCompare Belly of the Whale, the first of the dark hours. Near Villain Victory is a subtrope. The Cornered Rattle Snake is someone who begins to fight back despite appearing to have no chance of survival. Hope Springs Eternal is the natural conclusion of such a moment... unless, of course, the story features a Downer Ending.\\nThe Trope Namer is a proverb that claims that \\\"The darkest hour is just before the dawn,\\\" but its exact origins are uncertain. Most likely, English theologian and historian Thomas Fuller was the first one to say something like it in his 1650 religious travelogue A Pisgah-Sight Of Palestine And The Confines Thereof, where it is quoted, \\\"It is always darkest just before the Day dawneth.\\\"\\nIt should go without saying, but \\\"Here there be spoilers!\\\""

If it is some kind of fleet you want to show, you can just as much make them run in squadrons, and the additional benefit is that in opposition to common soldiers, even a lone ship is likely to impress, either with her guns, or herself.\\nThus, Flaunting Your Fleets is a scene made of exceptional display of power, usually (though not a necessity) military, inducing squee in any closet militarist, often in form of squadrons upon squadrons, on the march or standing down, of starships, seaships, airships, airplanes or whatever else rocks your boat.\\nWhile Million Mook March is often invoked by characters in story, it is more likely for Flaunting Your Fleets to be directed straight towards the viewer. Works both in picture and in writing. In the former, it often uses a camera trick where the camera's changing field gradually shows more and more items (see Troy in the Film examples section). In the latter, it tends to assume the form of Description Porn, often together with a Long List of unit numbers and names and giving descriptions of individual vessels or ship types, thus blurring the division between straight description of the fleet as whole and Technology Porn of its constituents (see The Iliad, on which Troy was based).\\nA close cousin to Technology Porn and Gun Porn, and Million Mook March may be considered a subtrope.

Instead of soaring through the open skies, the Cool Plane will be forced to maneuver through a narrow canyon; the spaceship will be in an Asteroid Thicket, near an Unrealistic Black Hole, or through the guts of a massive ship or space station; the submarine will be forced to operate at (or beyond) its maximum diving depth. Basically, our heroes are forced to take a route that would be a bad idea at the best of times, much less under enemy fire, on a time limit, with dire consequences for failure.

Done correctly, it shows off the main character's courage, resolve, and Improbable Piloting Skills, allows them to defeat the Big Bad in one fell swoop, and provides plenty of chances for Visual Effects of Awesome.

This handy bit of Applied Phlebotinum can deploy a grappling hook with laser-guided precision to a secure holding point at the top of any tall building, allowing its user to climb with ease. Particularly spiffy examples are equipped with motors, and can function as field-expedient elevators as their users hold on for dear life. It can also be used to implement the Building Swing, though its primary function is usually just for climbing. It also lends itself to You Will Not Evade Me.\\nIn settings that predate firearms the alternative is the grappling arrow used by bow wielding protagonists. While it can be an arrow with a grappling hook more often it's just a standard arrow with a rope tied to it.\\nThe Grappling-Hook Pistol is generally a fairly bulky item for a handheld pistol, though unreasonably small for the length of line and hook firing charge that it contains. Its limited utility makes it a special-purpose item that the hero is unlikely to carry... but it generally conveniently appears from hammerspace when it is needed.\\nThe hooks themselves are Plot-Sensitive Items, capable of all three variants of Instant Knots - latching onto, wrapping the cable around, or piercing their target, depending on the needs of the script. The wrap-around cable is a strange effect, as it always attaches to the anchor point snugly enough to support whatever is on the other end of the cable on the first try. If the cord can automatically retract, the person can just hold on with one hand with inhuman strength to get pulled up; this is especially dramatic if they're holding someone else with their other arm. It's also very handy when you find yourself or an innocent civilian falling, but let's hope the cord has some elasticity.\\nGrappling guns actually exist (see \\\"Real Life\\\" below), but the real ones are somewhat larger than depicted on screen, especially if not base-fired only (though recent designs allows more compact systems).

      "general": "As you know, we are Describing the trope As You Know Here.\\nThis is a form of exposition where one character explains to another something that they both know, but the audience doesn't or may have forgotten.\\nIn discussions of science fiction, this is often \\\"As You Know, Bob\\\" (abbreviated AYKB), or occasionally, \\\"Tell me, Professor [about this marvelous invention we all use every day and have no reason to be talking about except to inform the audience]\\\". Other common variations involve a newspaper reporter sent to cover events, or conversation between two supporting characters \\u2014 hence another name, \\\"maid and butler dialogue\\\".\\nTerry Pratchett refers to the fantasy fiction version as the \\\"As you know, your father, the king...\\\" speech.\\nThis is also a common feature of pilot episodes, where characters' backgrounds and relationships need to be established for the first time. Likewise, when new characters are introduced or the writers believe a reminder is in order, characters will explicitly refer to each other by name during a regular conversation, when this is rarely done in real life: \\\"Say, Alice, how are you enjoying your coffee?\\\" \\\"Why, it's delicious, Bob, thanks for asking. How are you coming along, Carol?\\\"\\nThis is also quite common on medical drama shows like ER, Scrubs, and Grey's Anatomy, where common medical phenomena and simple procedures must be explained to the laymen in the audience. In most cases, this is achieved by explaining the disease or procedure to an intern or non-professional character.\\nOn some shows, characters will \\\"As You Know\\\" in order to provide information that was already provided in a previous episode (that viewers might have missed) or even earlier in the show (for those who just tuned in), to the great annoyance of dedicated fans. (e.g. Just Tuned In: \\\"Remember, Bob, you only have 20 minutes to defuse the bomb...\\\" or Previous Episode: \\\"Jane is really mad at you for running over her dog last week, isn't she?\\\") Soap operas or adventure-type shows will often circumvent this with a \\\"When we last left our heroes\\\" recap at the beginning of each two-parter.\\nThis may also happen with solitary characters (in thought rather than in speech), who, apparently, have such bad memory problems that they have to constantly remind themselves what they're doing right now and what happened in the near past.\\nAlthough writers try to avoid this by using The Watson (since not explaining anything sometimes results in the audience being too busy trying to figure out what's going on to enjoy the show), using this trope is not always a bad thing. Also, the most common alternative is to give the protagonist amnesia so he doesn't know, which isn't really considered a better option. The Idiot Hero and Fish out of Water are also acceptable tropes to employ to make this trope more believable. A third form is to have two characters comparing information to each be sure that the other does in fact know. A fourth is to have the characters have an argument, since arguments are among the few real-life situations in which people remind each other of things they both already know.note\\u00A0\\\"How could you do X? You know perfectly well that Y...\\\" Breaking the Fourth Wall to have the characters know they are informing the audience is very old, but obviously suitable only for broadly comic works.\\nIt was ridiculously common in post-World War II literature, to the point that readers expected it and could become confused if the writer left it out. This might be the most universal trope found in postwar literature; you find it in works by everyone from George Orwell to Barbara Cartland to Rex Stout. (One wonders which one of the three would be most insulted by that grouping.)\\nGenerally more acceptable when dealing with characters who are in situations where exposition is actually going on in-universe, e.g. military briefings or scientific lectures. In these cases, the phrase is less used to explain something and more to bring focus to a particular fact. (\\\"As you know, we lost contact with Delta Squad this morning...\\\" or \\\"As you may know, the proton has a mass of...\\\")\\nSpecific variants:\\n\\n And Another Thing\\n I've Never Seen Anything Like This Before\\n Let Me Get This Straight\\n Luckily My Powers Will Protect Me\\n Tell Me Again\\n\\nSee also: Mr. Exposition, The Watson, Expospeak, Captain Obvious, Viewers Are Morons.

Usually, the speaker cut a deal with the villain to get the intended victims off easy, or simply hadn't seen the full extent of the evil scheme. This is also likely to come from The Mole who has found himself sympathizing with the protagonists he's betraying. This is a clue that the Turn Coat might not be all bad, even though they've just sold the good guys out, or that they just discovered how Eviler Than Thou their new boss really is. It's often Foreshadowing a Heel-Face Turn on the part of the traitor, though they are likely to receive Redemption Equals Death as reward for their last-minute repentance.\\n Also frequently spoken by a captive good guy who has been convinced by the villain, in a Hostage for MacGuffin scenario, to give him the location of the Rebel base, Secret Identity or Achilles' Heel of the hero, or other plot-driving information in exchange for the safety or freedom of something or someone the captive cares deeply about. More rarely, spoken as \\\"You said you'd let me go!\\\" by a Dirty Coward ally of the heroes captured by the villain and tricked into squealing on them with a promise of mercy.\\n More rarely still, the \\\"You said you'd let me go!\\\" variation is spoken when a Mook or other underling is captured and threatened by a particularly unscrupulous or vengeful Anti-Hero and squeals on the bad guys in exchange for his life. This line is never uttered if the hero is actually intending to show mercy and let the badnik go. Simply hearing it said indicates the captive is about to discover just how much Darker and Edgier their captor really is.\\nIn all of the above cases, the villain's response is always the same: \\\"I Lied.\\\"\\nSomehow, the speaker is always surprised by this.\\nVariants include \\\"You said you were just going to scare him!\\\" and \\\"You said you'd only hurt them a little!\\\", among others. Another variant is \\\"You promised me mercy\\\" / \\\"And you shall have it\\\" (shoots victim in head). By the standards of those who practice this variant, that is mercy.\\nIf the villain had no reason to not keep his promise (Say, releasing the girlfriend of a hero who only got into this to save her, and who has no interest in stopping his evil plan), then he may be carrying a Villain Ball.\\nWhen the villain follows through with the Exact Wording of this agreement, it's either Unhand Them, Villain! or False Reassurance. This is one case when the bad guy is exempt from Villains Never Lie - revelations may be true. Promises may not. Compare/Contrast: I Will Punish Your Friend for Your Failure.

It's like trying to make a coherent generalization about people who don't like baseball.\\n\\n\\nIn fiction, however, while it is reasonably common to see a character who is never shown practicing or even mentioning religion, it's generally only characters with a fair degree of cynicism and bitterness who will state outright that they are an atheist. Some of the more common character traits are:\\n A Cynicism Catalyst or some other trauma, or a miserable life in general was the direct cause of their 'conversion' to atheism, as well as a Rage Against the Heavens at a God who lets such things happen. Consequently, the Hollywood Atheist can easily be made to reverse or reexamine their lack-of-belief if something good happens, even if there is no explicit connection between the good event and divine intervention. Conversely, when something bad happens (especially their own death approaching) the atheist will suddenly become enough of a believer to pray for help. This is where you get the old (and disproved) saying \\\"There are no atheists in a foxhole.\\\" See Nay-Theist if they do believe in a higher power but have a grudge against it for these reasons.\\n Atheists have been turned off by hypocrites and villains acting in the name of religion and only need to be shown a non-hypocritical or heroic believer to see the light.\\n Atheists show contempt, dislike, or even hatred towards religion and gods (which may become contradictory to the point of them seeming to be NayTheists instead), and will mock believers to no end.\\n Atheists are somehow simply unaware of religion, and will happily convert on the spot when informed of the rudiments of whatever dogma the work is endorsing. Expect them in an Author Tract (despite the name this shows up as early as the book Hayy ibn Yaqzan, making this trope Older Than Feudalism).\\n Atheists only seem to have arguments against their culture's predominant religion. In the real world this is most often Christianity, and to a lesser extent, its brethren Judaism and Islam. They'll have nothing bad to say against Asia originating or tribal religions.\\n Atheists are materialists and probably technophiles/transhumanists/roboticists as well.\\n Atheists are hedonists and selfish individuals who only care about themselves and their own happiness.\\n Atheists have a pseudo-religious belief in science and logic. That is scientism, not atheism. Some atheists may hold this, but again, that isn't a defining trait.\\n Atheists are depressed, lonely, anti-social, and often Straw Nihilists.\\n Atheists are straight-out evil. In addition to lacking religion, they also lack any kind of empathy for others. Bonus points are awarded if they believe that rejecting religion makes them exempt from the concept of good and evil (which only ever seems to make someone a villain). Compare and contrast Faith Heel Turn.\\n Atheists are smugly convinced of their own intellectual superiority and usually blinded to the \\\"truth\\\" by their own elitist pretensions. Usually, they are shown as being Not So Different from their religious opponents, especially the more fanatical ones.\\n Atheists don't just argue against theism, but may actively discriminate against, harass, and even persecute believers.\\nCommon to all portrayals of the Hollywood Atheist is the idea that faith is the natural state and something must occur to drive the character away from the norm. Given that the majority of humans worldwide are religious (to varying degrees), this understandably colors media greatly, but still, it's always 'my reason for not believing is X.' One never hears 'I just don't have a reason to believe', which is a common (if not the most common) real-life reason given by atheists.\\nSee also Acceptable Religious Targets. A major exception is science fiction which often goes so far the other way as to state that Religion Is Wrong and humanity has Outgrown Such Silly Superstitions. For atheists living in fantasy settings where the existence of gods is irrefutable, see Flat Earth Atheist and Nay-Theist.\\nAs with other strawman tropes, Hollywood Atheism is a caricature of Real Life attitudes crafted to suit the purposes of various authors; by definition, real atheists are not examples. The fact that there are a small minority of Atheists in Real Life who exhibit these characteristics does not mean that you should assume that those characteristics apply to any atheist you meet.\\nCompare with Holier Than Thou, and see Crisis of Faith. See also Useful Notes on Atheism. Not to be confused with some of the American conservative movement's more vocal members' view of Hollywood's \\\"war on Faith\\\"."

This is the Supporting Protagonist: someone who would normally be a secondary character by conventions of the genre is the main character. When done correctly, this provides a Point of View other than what's typical. When done wrong, it could easily lead to the character becoming The Load.\\nIn many cases, this means choosing someone other than The Hero to be the protagonist. For instance, the story follows the Big Good as they watch The Hero on their adventure. In this case they are also the Supporting Leader. In another case the story could follow the Side Kick as they support the hero. The third case is Supporting Protagonist being The Hero, but not The Chosen One. It can also be that we follow this protagonist for much of the story, but the one who gets to resolve the in-story conflict is not him/her.\\nIn a mystery, it means choosing someone other than the detective.

In Historical Fiction, it means choosing someone other than the important historical figure.\\nIt's common in Japanese works with a supernatural touch (Light Novels, Fish out of Water scenarios, etc.) in order to have somebody to spout exposition to.

Heh, heh, heh...\\nRats are probably the most formidable and tenacious mammals in existence, being blessed with swift feet, durable incisors, impressive cunning and intelligence, numbers, and an all-consuming sense of self-preservation.

      "general": "A subversion of the Even Evil Has Standards trope, when a villain refuses to do something horrible not because it is too evil and/or abhorrent, but rather because it's not in their interests to do so; it's a waste of limited resources, and may even be counter-productive.\\nSometimes, even a villain finds it furthers their aims to Pet the Dog from time to time, even if it's just for show. Maybe there's dog-kicking in their past; even if there isn't, the Pragmatic Villain is the type to have studied those who have. No matter the combination of dogs and boots, and they're sure to have investigated them all quite thoroughly, there just isn't anything to be gained by it and one's toes get a little tender after too much of that kind of thing. Also, a dog kicked too often can bite back. Though a pragmatic villain is likely to be less destructive than their Card-Carrying Villain counterpart, they are made all the more dangerous by their focus on their ultimate goals and their reluctance to carry the Villain Ball.\\nOftentimes, their course of action is determined solely by discerning which would best serve their purposes. Being evil, to them, just keeps their options open when it comes to illegal and immoral acts, and doesn't stop them from using 'legitimate' (or at least socially respectable) strategies and tactics. Heroes are sometimes surprised when said villains do something \\\"unexpectedly\\\" evil later, when they were doing \\\"good\\\" things before. Should kicking the dog become a necessary step in their masterplan however, expect their kick to have the power and precision of a football player going for a game winning field goal, usually while stating it's Nothing Personal.\\nVirtually any Villain with Good Publicity tends to be a master of this trope, especially one who is also Dangerously Genre Savvy. Villains With Good Publicity almost always have years of experience in earning the trust of their supporters, and are well aware that angering dog-lovers (among others) will not advance their cause and may hinder it. Even for those who don't happen to be Affably Evil, if any dog-kicking is deemed necessary, they will keep these acts of cruelty out of the public eye, or when they can't do that, they'll do what they can to make it look like the victim deserved it; how evil they truly are under cover of darkness must remain shrouded in darkness. They also tend to be masters of the Xanatos Gambit. The Noble Demon will probably attempt to justify his nobility this way, with varying degrees of believability. Whenever there's a Generic Doomsday Villain or an Omnicidal Maniac around, there's a good chance the other villains will form an Enemy Mine with the heroes to stop them, as they want to rule the world, not destroy it. Or at least not steal their job of fighting the heroes. Even most Chaotic Evil Ax-Crazy villains who do things For the Evulz fall to this trope. There's no fun or challenge for them if everyone's dead \\u2014 they'd be left forlorn with no idea what to do next.\\nAn obvious foil to villains with Complexity Addiction (who will do the evil deed anyway), though some do manage to pair the two. A subtrope is Can't Kill You, Still Need You if applied to villains. Contrast Stupid Evil, where the villain hurts their own interests by preferring indiscriminate evil. Compare and contrast Shoot the Dog, where a hero or anti-hero does a morally questionable act for pragmatic reasons. See also Cooperation Gambit, Cut Lex Luthor a Check, Dick Dastardly Stops to Cheat, Sanity Has Advantages, and Bread and Circuses. Compare Evil Virtues, where a villain has good traits. For the less evil and more moderate version of this trope, see Jerk with a Heart of Jerk.\\nNot to be confused with Do Wrong, Right, where an evil act is decried for being poorly executed, and in which the standards that the evil act fails to adhere to are not necessarily those held by a Pragmatic Villain: e.g. one villain could invoke Do Wrong, Right on another for lacking flair."

      "general": "In much of the world, national or local governments fund public roadways and highways, in part, by charging an annual fee to every vehicle owner. To prove the vehicle owners have paid the fee, a metal plate with a unique identification is affixed to the rear or front bumper (often both) of the vehicle (this also gives a useful way of identifying each vehicle). Usually, the identification is a short string of random or semi-random figures, letters or both. Sometimes, the first few or last few digits may identify the sub-region where the car is registered, but usually the digits are assigned sequentially.\\nHowever, always eager to express their individuality or the depth of their pocketbooks, some vehicle owners want to have cooler license plates than everyone else. Equally eager to charge rich idiots more money, most governmental units let them order custom plates, for a fee.\\nAs a result, many jurisdictions that issue license plates will, for an extra fee, allow you to choose the alphanumeric string on your license plate, rather than assigning you a random sequence of letters and figures. Outright profanity is usually banned, although some drivers manage to sneak things like PHA Q through the cracks.\\nWriters and production designers will often include a vanity license plate as visual shorthand for the personality of the car's owner. A Corrupt Corporate Executive may have BIG BOSS on his BMW or Lexus. A Jerk Jock may have UR MY FAN or BEST QB. Rich bastards in general are likely to have a Cool Car with a plate along the lines of MY TOY. Heck, the Cool Car in general almost certainly has a vanity plate of some sort.\\nFor obscenely rich characters, '[Name of character] 1', '2', '3', and so on is also popular, as it gives the character a chance to bring attention to the fact that he has several cars, and has to keep them numbered to keep track of them. Any character with such a plate can generally be assumed to be a total dick.\\nOf course, this trope is often Truth in Television. It inspired Wink Martindale to create the Game Show Bumper Stumpers for the USA Network. This trope is not to be confused with Vanity Plate, which was named after the same real-world phenomenon.\\nDifferent cultural reactions to these kinds of plates come from how much they cost. In the USA, this is seen as \\\"mostly harmless\\\" (if a mite gauche) since most vanity plates cost within the range of $25 to $50 extra (with extreme ends of $10 in Virginia and $100 in Minnesota). However, most countries do not allow personalized plates as can happen in the States, merely the buying/selling of official plates with amusing alphanumeric combinations. One of the reasons UK-based people like the Top Gear folks et al. are so dismissive of vanity license plates is that they cost more than 10 times as much across the pond, so not only are you an attention-seeking bore, but you also have more money than is good for you.\\nNote that in the United States \\u2013 where the vast majority of both fictional and real-life examples occur \\u2013 no state now issues license plates with more than seven characters (the less-populous ones use six or even four). During the early 1980s California was issuing some 8-character license plates, because they had a state law that allowed CB Radio Licensees to be issued their call sign as their license plate number (most states only granted this privilege to Ham radio operators) and at the time, so many people were applying for CB licenses that the FCC had to issue 8-character CB licenses, of the format WXXX 1234 or KTHX 1138. Shortly thereafter the FCC realized it was overwhelmed and threw in the towel, eliminating licensing for CB radio use. But, at that time, you could get an 8-character license plate, at least in California. But not now. So if you see a car tag with eight characters (other than a CB license format plate from the early 1980s) or any with more than 8, it's completely fictional. Also, every state bans the use of offensive words/phrases on their tags. You'll never see a real-life plate that reads \\\"FUCKYOU\\\" or any variant thereof.\\nNote: When adding an example that's heavily abbreviated or requires netspeak to understand, translate. The message may not be obvious to other readers.\\n\\nExamples"

The attackers have just performed the Mega Maw Maneuver. The reasons for using this tactic are usually as a form of piracy. Once inside the large vehicle, the target is at the mercy of its captors, and can be easily boarded, plundered, or seized without risking damage in a firefight.\\nWhile certainly an interesting maneuver, it does pose several problems in Real Life. For one, its success hinges upon the maw ship being much larger and much faster than its victims. For another, the very real possibility of the target performing some desperate evasive action trying to get away would pose considerable danger. Sometimes Tractor Beams are used to speed up the chase and/or explain away why the target isn't performing any evasive actions.\\nIn other words, if there was any real potential to this tactic, it probably would have been tried by now.\\nNot to be confused with maneuvering with Mega Maw.\\nCompare: Swallowed Whole, which is this trope but with monsters.\\nCompare: Driving into a Truck, which is the opposite of this trope."

      "general": "In science fiction, even if a ship has shields that can shrug off atomic weapons, ramming it with another ship always manages to take it down.\\nThis is, in fact, pretty credible. The impact of a heavy freight train going 60 mph is equal to that of a 1 to 2 tons of TNT \\u2014 it's just over a much smaller area, and going in one direction. Most spaceships are far heavier, and can go far faster. An object traveling at 3 km/sec does damage equal to its own weight in TNTnote\\u00A0Among hard SF enthusiasts, this is known as Rick Robinson's Law of Space Combat. An object impacting at 6 km/sec would do damage equal to 4 times its weight in TNT, and would be said to do \\\"4 Ricks\\\" worth of damage.; a spaceship traveling at 90% of the speed of light does damage equal to its own weight in antimatter. And that's not even taking into account the ramming ship detonating its reactors and munitions when it hits.\\nIn fact, the usual mistake is not to make ramming work too well but to make it work not well enough. Survivors are not unknown, and the effect is usually depicted as \\\"Ship A crashes into ship B and ship B crumples and breaks apart in slow motion,\\\" where it should look like, and is only more rarely is portrayed as, \\\"Ship A crashes into ship B and both ships are vaporized in a titanic fireball\\\". Likewise, small fighter craft often smash into bigger ships with no visible effect, when they ought to be wreaking massive devastation.\\nAnd then there's the momentum, even ramming at a few tens of meters per second could create enough force for the people in at least one of the ships to slam into the walls at speeds high enough to kill or injure them. Though interestingly when one of the ships weighs a lot more than the other the people in the bigger ship might only be knocked off their feet, so for a bigger ship ramming into a much smaller one at 10-30 m/s could be a great tactic for taking out enemy crews while leaving the both ships intact...\\nThat said, there is one challenge for a ramming ship, which is reaching the target in the first place. At realistic space combat distances (hundreds if not thousands of kilometers), the target should have plenty of time to see the attempt coming and either blow up the ramming ship or dodge out of its way. This ought to lead to a tense cat-and-mouse game as the rammer tries to close the distance and compensate for the target's evasive maneuvers, and the target tries to stay clear long enough to score a killing hit \\u2014 the ramming ship is essentially a large missile, and the target would be performing a High-Speed Missile Dodge. Sadly, things are never portrayed like this.\\nThe reason for this, of course, is that space ramming depictions are probably based on the Space Is an Ocean mindset, and the cultural memory of Real Life naval tactics of the ancient world. Before the advent of cannons, ramming the other ships was the main method for taking them out. Note that this is where the term \\\"ramming speed\\\" comes from \\u2014 the horator would begin beating the drums faster so the slaves at the oars of the galleys rowed faster in order to drive the ram deep into the side of the enemy ship. Ramming tactics made a brief comeback in the latter half of the nineteenth century, with steamships, when they started making ships out of metal instead of wood which made older cannons obsolete. Even then, battleships continued to be built with bows designed for ramming for many years after the tactic ceased to be relevant. In fact, in the early years of ironclad battleships, their armor was so effective against the relatively primitive guns of the era that ramming was seen as the only viable tactic against an ironclad. Even past this point, many ships have done a LOT of damage to each other with accidental or deliberate ramming, in particular sinking a large number of surfaced submarines.\\nCompare Colony Drop, which, depending on what you're dropping, takes this trope to its logical extreme. For land vehicles, see Car Fu or Forklift Fu. In sci-fi terms, a Sister Trope to Kinetic Weapons Are Just Better.\\n\\nExamples"

      "general": "A quick and easy way to suggest a group of people are evil in fiction is to give them uniforms that resemble those worn by the Third Reich.

When a group puts on the Reich, expect to see the classic fascist colors of red background, black symbol, and white circle and an easily recognizable, sometimes swastika-like insignia somewhere... or everywhere.\\nIncidentally, some of the uniforms for the real SS were manufactured by Hugo Boss (yes, that Hugo Boss) using slave labor. Those Wacky Nazis were actually pretty snappy dressers despite being evil, which just furnishes another reason for authors and costume designers to borrow their motifs. Very common when State Sec is around.\\nIn a similar manner, a fictional evil organization may sometimes be copying the uniforms or symbolism of other historical entities that have an easily-recognizable style and a bad reputation in the minds of the audience. Common examples include the Roman Empire, the Mongols, the Soviet Union and Imperial Japan, among others. Cultural variations may occur, with different styles being considered stereotypically evil in different parts of the world.\\nThis trope is named after the expression \\\"Puttin' on the Ritz\\\".\\nNote that this trope covers the uniforms.

Some stories even make it a cyclical set up, with the surviving rescuers sending out their own ominous distress call.

Most likely, the hero is experiencing a psychological, supernatural, or magical attack that gives him/her ambiguous chest pains or a mind-splitting headache. You can bet that the hero will be doubled over in pain, unable to move.\\nScenes with this trope can be pretty frightening anyway if used well, like with trippy spirit monsters chanting and hovering over the hero, or surreal montages of the hero's fears playing before his/her eyes. (See one of the possible causes, Mind Rape.)\\nSoul Pains usually can't kill a character by themselves. Sometimes Having Soul Pains could bring about the character's death, although it's never obvious exactly when the pain would get bad enough to actually kill him/her. Darker and Edgier works will use this trope to drive characters to suicide, just to make it all stop.\\nSometimes used to bring the battle between good and evil to a personal level.

If they do have substance, they're Hard Light.\\nWhat media commonly identifies as a hologram is not actually a hologram, it's a volumetric display. Actual holograms are 3D images on 2D surfaces, and not visible from arbitrary angle.

Often, the real leader feeds them instructions via audio device, hand signals, extensive training, or other means so the leader can conduct meaningful policy. Usually, the decoy is willing to die for the leader, and has little to no political ambitions at all.\\nWhere this gets interesting is that the decoy doesn't need to look anything like the leader either. The leader may be a Master of Disguise or can at least clean up nicely, which she'll use in order to move around royal and civil society freely. In fact, the leader will likely enjoy going about with the common folk.

      "general": "Guns are dangerous things. Extremely dangerous things. They're not just designed to hurt; they're designed to kill. With a flick of a single finger, one can take a life. Such power needs to be respected, and it shouldn't be surprising that there are various obvious safety rules in place when using a gun, that anybody who wants to use a firearm should know. Even then an expert can conceivably make a serious (and possibly fatal) mistake when handling a gun. There is even a saying among gunsmiths that \\\"There are two types of gun owners. Those who have had their guns discharge accidentally, and those who will have their guns discharge accidentally.\\\"\\nMany writers, actors, artists, and directors, however, do not know these rules. What results from this are scenes where characters are doing things they shouldn't, such as placing their fingers on the triggers of their weapons when not about to fire, or pointing their weapons at people who they are not trying to shoot; one particularly common example is foolish officers making routine arrests (e.g. drunk driving or check fraud) at gunpoint for no real reason. This is particularly troublesome when these people are supposed to be experts with lots of experience with their weapons.\\nThe distinction between this trope and Reckless Gun Usage is that this involves people who either should know gun safety based on their profession, or are stated to have extensive experience with firearms while Reckless Gun Usage involves people who are likely not familiar with basic firearm safety. If this is done for comedic purposes it's Juggling Loaded Guns. If this shows up and somebody gets shot, it's I Just Shot Marvin in the Face. If the rules are followed and somebody gets shot anyway, that's Reliably Unreliable Guns going off. Firing in the Air a Lot is always a case of this, as are Pants-Positive Safety and Gun Twirling. The trope also usually goes hand in hand with Stray Shots Strike Nothing.\\nAnother media cliche not recommended is entering a room and immediately pointing your gun forward and waving it about the room in search of potential threats as you could either drop or accidentally discharge your weapon or if there are civilians in the room, convince them that you're a hostile and cause panic. However, this is not a problem if you know there's a hostile somewhere in the building and you're trying to get rid of him.\\nMay also be the writer hinting that a character isn't as professional as he should be.\\nSee Guns Do Not Work That Way, for links to Tropes of the most common offenders.\\nNote that there is a very good reason why all of the examples here are listed under Artistic License, as trying to actually replicate any of them could lead - and has led - to accidents, many of them fatal.

As in what could be a large room becomes huge and cavernous.

When heroes find themselves trapped in a room with all doors and windows locked, the quickest exit is always through the ventilation duct. Air vents also work excellently in reverse for breaking in and infiltrating a facility, as well.\\nCovers require little effort to remove, openings are within reach, they can support the weight of a person and wide enough in diameter to allow an adult to pass through, there are no internal obstacles except for the occasional Deadly Rotary Fan blocking the branching corridors, they are free of normal sheet metal's dangerously sharp edges, they are totally soundproof, away from any security cameras and there's never a lack of light or chance of getting lost unless the plot calls for it.\\nAnd the escapee always emerges without having picked up so much as a speck of dust.\\nThe Genre Savvy villain would have smaller air ducts, post guards around the openings or line their ducts with barbed wire and broken glass. It even appears near the top of the Evil Overlord List.\\nThis is practically a Discredited Trope by now, and requires some effort to justify if it's to be used seriously. Despite that, it's also a shock that it's actually happened at least once in real life. Frank Morris and his accomplices escaped from Alcatraz using the large ventilation duct that led them to the roof. And that leads to knowing that large industrial, commercial and construction complexes need to have enough air flow to manage their needs (like hot equipment or extremely deep locations for personnel use), which often requires a large ventilation system. It's not practical in general use though, still, as grates bolted in place still block your entrance and getting towards office space will shrink the vents.\\nSome large universities (MIT and Caltech in particular) have longstanding \\\"steam tunnel spelunkers\\\" clubs, who often use air ducts (among other things) for exploring, getting around campus quickly, or pulling off pranks. Readers of this trope should be advised that this is extremely dangerous, not to mention illegal \\u2014 steam tunnels are usually hot, cramped, and frequently criss-crossed by scalding-hot piping, and explorers face trespassing charges and possible academic sanctions if they're discovered within.\\nHowever, most attempts to sneak in or out via air duct aren't very successful since people tend to be fairly large and ducts tend to be fairly small, plus the fact that air can bend at ninety degree angles and fit through grates much more readily. There have been numerous cases where enterprising criminals have attempted to rob a store by sneaking through the ducts and end up getting stuck. The usual ending is the embarrassed criminal being either pulled or cut out of the duct by the fire department and then promptly handed over to the authorities.\\nCompare Absurdly Spacious Sewer for a similar trope which takes place beneath buildings rather than in them.\\n\\nExamples"

      "general": "Speculative Fiction often uses the real-world scientific knowledge that was actually available when it was written. There is nothing wrong with that, and indeed powering and justifying your world with Hard Science is, to many people, preferable to Applied Phlebotinum and Techno Babble. Basing your fictional science off of real world science is an excellent way to create Willing Suspension of Disbelief.\\nThere's one problem with this approach, however: Science progresses. Around the 1500's, some cultures thought that the sun revolved around the earth. Around the 1900's, there still were scientists who openly questioned the existence of subatomic particles, like electrons and photons. As recently as the turn of the century, the existence of dark energy, and the corresponding fact that the expansion of the universe is accelerating rather than slowing, was not widely known in the scientific community. And many of our current assumptions about Life, the Universe, and Everything will inevitably be questioned or disproven in the future. Therefore, when a scientific theory used widely in speculative fiction gets Jossed by new scientific discoveries, it's because Science Marches On.\\nScientific terminology is also subject to change, and it can be particularly jarring if a story set Twenty Minutes into the Future uses names that were widespread a few years ago, but are obsolete now, and are likely to remain so. For example, the word \\\"atomic\\\" has been mostly supplanted by \\\"nuclear\\\". Likewise, older science fiction written in the US did not foresee the adoption of metric measurements.\\nAs a result, what seems like bad research in older fiction (in particular Space Does Not Work That Way and Artistic License \\u2013 Biology) is actually this: They did do the research; it's just that said research is now outdated. Technology Marches On is a subtrope. Zeerust may be considered a sub-trope of this, as the old ideas of \\\"futuristic\\\" look dated now due to new advances in unforeseen directions. For instances where the change is in the historical record, see Dated History; when it's in society itself, see Society Marches On.\\nThis can also include cases where writers predicted an advance in engineering that never happened for practical reasons, such as having our entire civilization powered by nuclear reactors by 1990, or having cities on the Moon in 2000. It's at least conceivable that such a thing could have happened in hindsight, but it would have been so expensive and unrewarding that it seems as absurd as things that have been actively contradicted by new scientific discoveries.\\nSee also I Want My Jetpack, Conviction by Counterfactual Clue, Artistic License. Opposite of Accidentally Accurate, where instead of being proven wrong, something presented in fiction is proven to be correct by science."

      "general": "Since Space Is an Ocean, Space Marines are the troops carried by spaceships, their roles paralleling those of conventional marines: mobile deployment, boarding hostile ships, securing ports \\u2014 including Space Stations \\u2014 from Space Pirates.\\nThese guys are the number one troops of choice for the humans in the Standard Sci Fi Setting.\\nSpace Marines first turn up in the short story \\\"Captain Brink of the Space Marines\\\" by Bob Olsen in Amazing Stories Volume 7, Number 8, of November 1932, and a later followup, 1936's \\\"The Space Marines and the Slavers.\\\" The trope, however, fully rose to prominence with the use of the term on the wildly popular Lensman Series beginning in 1934. In 1959, Starship Troopers codified the trope, popularizing the emblematic Power Armor and the array of exotic weaponry they wield.\\nWarhammer 40,000 from Games Workshop is notable for taking these aspects to a peak and becoming one of the more recognizable instances of the trope, if certainly not the first. Despite this, as of early 2013, the company claims ownership of a registered trademark (in the UK at least) on the name \\\"Space Marine\\\" (on occasions claiming \\\"Marine\\\" itself), though not the trope itself. This trademark has been used to make actual legal threats on occasion, most notably against the author of Spots The Space Marine.\\nThese elite soldiers have the cachet of conventional Marines. Add bulky Powered Armor and (sometimes) either Bio-Augmentation or cyber-augmentation (or both!) to get classic Super Soldiers.\\nIn many settings they fight as a squad, sometimes with Awesome Personnel Carrier support, or launched by Drop Pod. A notable exception to this are the many First Person Shooters that use the Space Marine background as a useful excuse to get a highly trained soldier alone on a hostile planet. This tradition starts with the much-imitated Doom series \\u2014 see A Space Marine Is You and One-Man Army.\\nThis page shouldn't be to be confused with the video game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, though that game pretty much is about them.\\nIt should be noted that the name \\\"space marine\\\" is actually a misnomer \\u2014 there's no water in deep space. Works aiming for more realism or a more Ray Gun Gothic feel may prefer to call them \\\"espatiers.\\\" But for those wanting more to invoke the Romantic Space Is an Ocean trope the name space marine works just fine. Sometimes, \\\"space marine\\\" is culturally translated into \\\"space [insert Bad Ass military unit here]\\\" - for instance in Russia space marines are often called \\\"space landing forces\\\" (kosmodesantniki) after the VDVnote\\u00A0Vozdushno-desantnye voyska, \\\"air-landing forces\\\". an airborne unit of the Russian military that has roughly the same reputation as the USMC and Royal Marines in American and British cultures.\\nNote: This trope is about the elite spaceborne soldiers themselves. Overly-generic Science Fiction military protagonists belong elsewhere, such as A Space Marine Is You for video games.\\n\\nExamples"

      "general": "Industrial complexes in which climactic battles are fought always seem to have been built with a callous disregard for the safety of workers. Inside, you're likely to find narrow catwalks with simple rope/cable (or no) handrails inevitably hung by what might as well be knitting yarn over open bubbling vats of green acid, massive exposed machinery flailing everywhere without protective covers, safety switches in awkward places far from the machinery they control, blast furnaces glowing fiery red, and other hazardous conditions so terrifying that any sane person would probably insist on a six-figure danger bonus to even go near the place.\\nAlmost every such complex includes a tower or shaft several dozen feet wide and hundreds of feet tall/deep, ringed with balconies and walkways from which one can easily slip, and at least one retractable bridge that doesn't seem to care if there is anybody on it before it retracts.\\nHigh-pressure/high-temperature pipelines are made of substandard materials that tear or rupture in response to any tap as hard as a mis-aimed punch, spewing superheated steam, flames, or some of that bright green acid everywhere. The only surfaces strong enough to withstand a bullet are the ones that will ricochet a shot back at the hero or the villain. Floors and walkways have a nasty tendency to collapse, large sections just falling away as if the builders ran out of rivets halfway through and hoped no one would notice.\\nHigh above, a crane swings round errantly, just waiting to drop random heavy objects on your head (or, if you're really unlucky, to collide with your head). Billows of smoke and steam belch from every other vent, and unidentified liquids drip unimpeded from somewhere high overhead to lubricate the already tenuous footing on the substandard walkways. Guardrails, if they're present at all, are flimsy and prone to breakage or collapse if anything close to a normal human's weight is put on them, making a Railing Kill a very real danger.\\nThe factory floor will, of course, be free of any safety equipment; although liberally supplied with lengths of chain, gas canisters, and sturdy iron bars. One bright spot in the safety-free environment is that a wall-mounted glass case containing a fire-axe is almost mandatory. It will be about the only thing on site that is in excellent condition.\\nAnd oddly enough, for all the lack of safety compliance, the factory's door will be unlocked or easily entered, and there will be not a single night watchman in the obviously dangerous facility.note\\u00A0Of course, would you want to wander around such a place for hours at a time every night? Usually all the crushing, spiking, and burning machinery will be left to run unattended; but if this is not the case, they will all be activated by a single exposed button or lever/switch placed on a bare stretch of wall.\\nIn short, if the United States or European Union's Occupational Safety and Health Administration ever saw the place, it would be condemned in seconds. Sometimes, the story will lampshade this by referring to the factory as \\\"abandoned\\\"; however, it will almost never be explained why an abandoned building has not been demolished at this point (or at least securely boarded up), why it still receives electricity, why all the machinery is present and operable as if it's itching to be the setting of a climactic showdown, or why such an unsafe factory was built in the first place.\\nOf course, this means the hero and the villain will immediately rush into the heart of such a complex to have their final battle, instead of just settling things in the parking lot. On the other hand, this does allow for the frequent accident of the villain falling to his doom. Any collateral damage in the battle will invariably hit a Big Red Button, cause Failsafe Failure, and No One Could Survive That resulting explosion.\\nThese environments still exist because they are visually interesting and allow the cowardly villain more opportunities to sneak around behind the hero, or the overmatched hero to find some way to even the scales against the seemingly omnipotent villain. Granted, it's always possible to put together a dramatic fight sequence in a perfectly balanced tournament-style environment (see the last segment of The Karate Kid (1984), or virtually any movie where martial arts is the foundation of the plot), but the ultimate authority on such matters in entertainment is, of course, the Rule of Cool.\\nThese facilities are also often referred to as \\\"Smoke and Fire Factories\\\", in reference to the fact that the function of the building is rarely explained, with smoke and fire as its only discernible outputs.\\nNote that if a villain plants a few explosives in such a place, it transforms from a mundanely unsafe facility into an instant Death Course. For the video game equivalent, see Eternal Engine and Malevolent Architecture. Construction Zone Calamity will usually employ this trope for laughs. Homicide Machines is when a horror film does this with everyday household appliances. No Seatbelts and Railing Kill are subtropes.\\nIncidentally, OSHA Compliance is not just about construction and design, but also about people in the facility following proper procedures, so the act of having a battle in a workplace is already non-compliance with OSHA, even without the smoke and flame.\\nThis trope is always present in a Nightmarish Factory.\\nThis has nothing to do with the lack of approval without accompanying a certain Wildling to go beyond The Wall.

      "ANewHope": "Between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, the very green Luke Skywalker was rather actively mentored by Obi-Wan's spirit. In Splinter Of The Minds Eye, which was both written and takes place between those two movies, Luke mentions feeling an \\\"agreeably crawly sensation\\\" like someone was standing with him, which he associates with his teacher. At the end of the book Obi-Wan actually briefly possessed Luke in order to fight off Darth Vader, since Luke and Leia would both have been killed otherwise. In Allegiance Obi-Wan patiently helped convey to Luke what the Force needed him to do, telling him not to shoot someone who later became an ally, helping him recognize a \\\"coiled-spring predator\\\" sensation in certain thugs, generally trying to talk him through things. When Luke, Han, and Chewbacca are locked into separate rooms by the Hand of Judgment, Obi-Wan tells Luke that Leia is in danger, and then has to tell the boy that he's not as trapped as he thinks.\\n Luke tries to figure things out on his own, but he can't, and so Obi-Wan just has to keep reluctantly giving him the next hint. ...Focus on the keypad. ...The first number is seven. *sigh* The numbers are seven seven eight one three one two. ...Now run your finger under this display frame. Take one of the blasters out of the secret compartment. Luke, not the biggest one.\\n Obi-Wan also appears several times to Ferus Olin to advise him in Rebel Force. Maybe because Olin's already a Jedi, he can manifest more easily to him than to rookie Luke.",

      "ANewHope": "The fact that only blue screen was available for A New Hope caused Luke's squadron to be changed from Blue to Red to avoid problems with blue markings.\\n Also in Return of the Jedi, the only reason Luke's new lightsaber is green is because the battle that takes place on Tatooine happens to have a bright blue sky. In some early trailers, Luke's saber is blue, but they chose to change it to green so it would show up against the sky properly.\\n In the original editions of the original trilogy, you'll notice that whenever R2-D2 is in space, his panels are painted black instead of blue to accommodate the chroma key effect. This was digitally fixed years later for the special edition versions.",
      "general": "More commonly known as green screen or blue screen (though that one also has a different meaning), the process by which a subject filmed on a camera can be seamlessly inserted into a scene generated by other means. It relies on filming the subject in front of a solid-color background \\u2014 any color will do, so long as it's not used in the foreground \\u2014 and adjusting the editing system to replace that color with the background signal.\\nThe main methods of controlling the background for live-action shots are, in increasing order of technological sophistication:\\n Finding one that already exists, and film on location.\\n Build a set.\\n Film the background separately, and project it onto a screen behind the actors while filming, typically via rear projection.\\n Double-exposing the film, which results in a slightly transparent foreground but is cheap.\\n The old analog Matte Shot, done with precise blocking of the camera frame.\\n Chroma Key.\\nThe background inserted via Chroma Key can be any visual image. CGI is the most common today, but it can be other live action footage, models, stop motion or cel animation just as easily.\\nThe color used is now entirely arbitrary. Blue was a popular choice in the early days of color motion pictures, because it is complementary to the reds found in human skin. Green became popular because digital editing systems can isolate green with less light in the background, and because lime green is less common than bright blue in costumingnote\\u00A0 There were also a few actors who also had Blue Screen-colored eyes; Broken Arrow (1996) offers an example, where an astute viewer can occasionally see special effects in John Travolta's irises. Magenta is sometimes used, as is black, but the latter is problematic, as it's almost impossible to shoot a person without having some black visible on their person, in eyes or shadows.\\nIf any part of an actor or prop is colored the same as the background, that part will disappear. Thus, sometimes the background color is chosen because of the colors to be used in the foreground action. The original run of Doctor Who, for instance, used green or yellow backgrounds even when blue was the most common color at The BBC, because a large number of its effects shots involved the TARDIS, a timeship that takes the form of a blue police phone box. The problem with using yellow was that foreground objects and actors always had a prominent yellow fringe around them. Normally, wardrobe and prop designers simply avoid using greens in the capture range, but this is not always possible; you'll occasionally see bloopers where weather forecasters have part of the meteorology map show up on their ties, for example.\\nThe invisibility effect can be used intentionally to allow a performer, or part of his body, to interact with props while remaining unseen. A garment that can be used for this purpose is a one-piece jumpsuit in the background color, with a full-face mask, and a mesh eye piece, called a \\\"gimp suit\\\" or, in the case of a blue background, a \\\"blueberry\\\" in the trade. Performers in recent Jim Henson Productions shows have used these suits to perform with puppets without having to raise them above their heads. The suit looks like a Ninja outfit, and that is not a coincidence, as it serves the same purpose as the black outfits traditionally worn by Japanese stagehands. See notes at Ninja.\\nAlmost all productions use Chroma Key at some point, but there are some standout examples. Also notable for causing occasional unintentional hilarity - when background and foreground are poorly matched, or the SFX budget is low, the effect is anything but seamless.\\nIt can be fairly tricky to create a viable Chroma-Key effect, especially with amateur equipment \\u2014 often, it requires fiddling with hue and saturation, and even then, there is often a faint, tell-tale 'border' around the subject where the green-screen footage and the 'real' actor don't match up."

      "general": "Is something big happening in the plot of your movie, TV show, or video game? Need a low-cost special effect to emphasize its importance? How about the All-Purpose Screen Shake? It's simple, cheap, conveys the meaning well, works with nearly any situation, and everybody's doing it!\\nIt's so easy: All you need to do is shake the screen! It doesn't matter which way you do it - up and down, left and right, or all over the place - it all looks great! Oh, and it might help if you play some sort of a \\\"rumble\\\" sound effect in the background at the same time - otherwise, it just looks really weird.\\nIf you're doing it for Live-Action TV don't forget to get the actors to start flinging themselves around. In fact they are half the job. Subtlety and dignity are best ignored. Supposedly, the casts of the various Star Trek series are very competitive concerning which cast is the best at the \\\"Star Trek Shake\\\". The cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation are allegedly the current champions.\\nShaking the screen in live-action media is almost discredited thanks to the fact that it's ugly and not believable. Nowadays, live action sets can be put on a platform that shakes the entire thing, giving a renewed sense of realism to falling on your arse. However, this technique remains popular in animation and video games. If the controller supports vibration-feedback, expect it to shake too.\\nThere is a version where the shaking is only used for exaggerated emphasis for something intensive happening that does not have the power to physically make anything shake within the fictional world; it really is just the \\\"screen\\\" (viewpoint) shaking. This is related to Painting the Medium.\\nHere are a few examples of situations where (apparently) it's appropriate to apply the Screen Shake (Read: blasphemous if you don't).\\n An earthquake\\n The starship you're on is suddenly accelerating\\n The starship you're on is being attacked\\n Someone activated the Self-Destruct Mechanism or defeated the Load-Bearing Boss and you have five minutes to escape the building (despite the fact that nothing has exploded yet)\\n You finally got to The Very Definitely Final Dungeon and the Big Bad has just hit the Big Red Button to put his master plan into action\\n You hit a switch and something bigger than you has shifted in the other room\\n A huge animal or something is walking around and shaking the ground with each footstep\\n An especially huge animal is roaring at you\\n A boss monster is fading in or out of existence right before your eyes\\n An explosion goes off nearby\\n Somebody is beating you up offscreen.\\nFor what this simulates, see Jitter Cam and Camera Abuse."
