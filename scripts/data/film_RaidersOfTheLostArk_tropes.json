      "general": "In order to keep a story moving, things need to happen a certain way. Sometimes everything is carefully set up and orchestrated, so that events unfold in an organic, natural fashion. More often than not, though, things happen the way they do simply Because Destiny Says So.\\nThere's just one tiny little problem with that theory: Sometimes, Destiny doesn't say so.\\nContrived Coincidence describes a highly improbable occurrence in a story which is required by the plot, but which has absolutely no outward justification \\u2014 not so much as a character saying There Are No Coincidences. The concept of \\\"destiny\\\" is glossed over altogether, and the events in question are simply disguised as mere happenstance. This would be jarring, but most of the time no attention is drawn to the event at all. It's just a narrative convention designed to skip over lots of irrelevant stuff by putting the important events all together, leaving the audience to forget the improbability of the event.\\nFor example, when two characters are separated in a huge battle involving millions of combatants, they will bump into each other again just in time for one to save the other's life. This is not highlighted as an example of destiny or fortuity in any way, and in fact the improbability of the two people meeting again at such a convenient moment is ignored altogether. If the coincidence is noted, it will be in the form of \\\"lucky you showed up when you did\\\" as if it provides some justification to the events that just transpired.\\nIn many an action/adventure show or movie, the protagonists are introduced to at the very beginning or portrayed to retain various gadgets that invariably play perfectly into a dire situation they find themselves in later on. It has the potential to be reasonable, such as bringing hiking equipment to a mountainous terrain mission, but more often than not it's just a flat-out Asspull. Honestly, what didn't Batman \\\"just so happen to\\\" carry in that little belt of his? (For that matter, RPGs and Adventure games are particularly common offenders, as inventory coincidences are often used to maintain the progression of gameplay.)\\nIt's not Destiny, it's not By Design; heck, the writer may not even bother calling it a coincidence. It just happens. Deal with it and move on.\\nIn cases where the coincidence is acknowledged, it's likely a Lampshade Hanging. Characters may invoke Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane for that.\\nCan be justified to a limited extent by the Anthropic Principle (see also The Other Wiki). Unlikely coincidences are bound to happen once in a while. Exceptional things don't happen to the main characters because they are main characters; rather, they are designated main characters because exceptional things happen to them. In other words, there would be no story without this first exceptional coincidence. The earlier in the story the plot-driving coincidences occur, the more leeway the writer has with them.\\nExcept for Farce. Contrived Coincidence is one of the driving forces of Farce, decreed by the Rule of Funny. This is a major reason why wariness is needed in other genres; too much of it will make the story farcical.\\nOne, less justifiable use for it is Doing In the Wizard. When the creator requires a coincidence, or worse, a combination of them, not to move the action forward but to say that it really could happen mundanely, it's not magic or the supernatural, the effect is usually not pleasing. Audiences disliked it as far back as the ancient Greeks, and Aristotle deplored it in Poetics.\\nMake note that like its sister trope Theory of Narrative Causality, this is one of the most pervasive tropes out there. Remember though, that just because a work uses this trope is not an automatic black mark against it. Even the greatest works out there sometimes need a great leap to get the plot to go in an interesting direction.\\nFor a more grandiose or plot-wrapping version, see Deus ex Machina. See also Fridge Logic for the moment it sinks in, and Not My Driver for the vehicular version.\\nIt's a Small World After All is a subtrope of this. A person who is a Weirdness Magnet tends to be a walking contrived coincidence. So is the variant of Framing the Guilty Party where the one doing the framing didn't know that party was guilty. Too many contrived coincidences may result in One Degree of Separation. Often, these can disguise a Gambit Roulette as The Plan."

      "general": "Jack suffered some minor injuries. All he needs is to have the scraps and cuts cleaned and bandaged \\u2014 maybe some antiseptic, or a few stitches, or a bandage. Fortunately, danger is no longer looming, and here comes Jill to do it; she is usually not The Medic (though she can be), the injuries not being severe enough to require professional attention.\\nLike Post-Victory Collapse, if The Cavalry Arrives Late, this can keep Jack out of the way while they clean up all the loose ends.\\nUnlike the After-Action Healing Drama (for serious wounds), it is a quiet moment after the battle or The Chase, or however he suffered the injuries. Therefore, even though he is not suffering Post-Victory Collapse, he will often react more strongly to the pain than during the thick of things \\u2014 with the humanizing effect of Afraid of Needles, in the antiseptic variation. Using iodine will get a particularly strong reaction.\\nJill often has to tell him to hold still when she treats the injuries \\u2014 often with a warning, in advance, that it will hurt. If she doesn't sympathize with him \\u2014 either in general or because she disapproves of how he got injured \\u2014 she may briskly inform him not to be a baby. She may try to soothe him if she does feel sympathetic, particularly if they are still in enemy territory, and he needs to keep quiet. Expect a Bandage Wince or two.\\nRegardless of how she feels about him, she may inform him that it was really stupid to get into trouble in the first place, which may or may not be followed by an acknowledgement of his courage, or even the Smooch of Victory. Criticism is less likely if it was on her behalf, where appropriate gratitude may be expressed. She may, however, deny that his intervention was needed; that sometimes is true.\\nIt also affords time for a tender moment after an action-packed scene (not to mention a Shirtless Scene), or merely for people to talk about discoveries made during the heat of battle. The first is usually a man getting patched up by a woman; it often advances the Florence Nightingale Effect, but seldom goes all the way from nothing to love because it's only one scene. If not, or if there is no UST, it's commonly used for exposition, since they can talk. Or, of course, both, particularly if this gives a chance for the Scar Survey. It can also be a Pet the Dog moment to show one character cares what happens to the other \\u2014 especially convenient for The Stoic, since it does not require him to evince any emotion.\\nWhen there is no one around to help, Self-Surgery may come into play. It tends to be far less pleasant. If she doesn't have a bandage handy, the subtrope From Dress to Dressing applies.\\nContrast Minor Injury Overreaction."

So close that in fiction, a character faced with a dreadful situation may start laughing out loud, before that laugh progressively melts into sobs. When this happens, the initial laughter is usually just there to mask the distress and isn't genuine. It's sort of a way to say \\\"I would like to laugh at that, but I just can't.\\\"\\nIt can also be done as a form of Mood Whiplash, where the character is in a middle of a laugh and learns bad news, immediately making them switch to tears. It has nothing to do with laughing so hard that you have tears in your eyes.\\nIt's also sometimes used by actors to cover for Corpsing, in scenes where they can get away with disguising a fit of the giggles as violent sobbing.\\nThis trope is surprisingly prevalent in Real Life with some often resorting to laughing when faced with any depressing or traumatic moments, before starting to express their true grief in tears.\\nA subtrope of Mirthless Laughter.

I love YOU man.\\\"\\nSuddenly Sober is the moment in a movie or TV show in which a drunken character suddenly transforms from a word-slurring, sidewalk-tripping, projectile-vomiting mess to a highly-coordinated, quick-thinking, somehow enlightened (and much more sober) version. This could be brought about by some sort of crazy action sequence, a sudden realization, or any other sort of device that moves the plot along.

Same rule applies to bridges over chasms.\\nThe later in the film that the destruction occurs, the more spectacular it is likely to be. If the hero is chased over a Rope Bridge in the first half an hour of the movie, that bridge will get off pretty light; a couple of the planks will snap after the hero steps on them. If this bridge is involved in the big finale, however, expect every support and mooring on one side of the bridge to give way or snap in half. Slowly and dramatically. With the hero in the middle, and twenty Mooks heading toward him from either end. And that's if it's not set on fire. Or rigged to blow.\\nAs there is No Ontological Inertia, the castle, fortress, temple or other elaborate and impressive structure that houses the Big Bad will make an even more elaborate and impressive explosion after he has been dispatched by the heroes (see Load-Bearing Boss and Collapsing Lair). A clue that It's Going Down is if anyone mentions the lair being \\\"bound to or crafted by the villain's will/power/magic.\\\" A more mundane version is when the imposing manor or tower from which the Evil Overlord was conducting his operations is beset by villagers wielding impromptu torches, battering rams, and various other weapons of architectural destruction. Usually, there will be a wide shot of the tower in flames and crumbling, even if it is constructed entirely out of stone.

If heroes attempt to use The Worf Barrage, they'll step out of the Smoke Shield and casually dust themselves off. When the Barrier Warrior tries to block their attacks with a Beehive Barrier, they'll break it into hexagons and knock them out. It can also take the form of a wrestler using their ultimate move and eliciting little more than a raised eyebrow from their opponent.\\nThey aren't canceling their opponent's powers, and they often aren't explicitly stated to be immune or resistant beforehand.

It's almost as if it were a make believe children's game where one of the kids refuses to \\\"play by the rules\\\" and insists they're invincible and immune to their playmate's imaginary powers. That's impossible... Right?\\nDepending on execution, this can be a terrifying reminder of exactly why they're called the BIG Bad, or a very groanworthy way of adding Fake Difficulty for a hero. If a villain has benefited from No Sell for the first four acts, by the time the hero masters his powers/confidence in the fifth, it's likely that he'll be the one using No Sell along with a Super Mode or Heroic Resolve.\\nThe trope's name is a term used in Professional Wrestling circles. In all types of acting, \\\"selling\\\" means an actor reacts as if he had been hit hard when the attack didn't make contact or was harmlessly light. Professional wrestling refers to it as a \\\"no-sell\\\" when the wrestler that was struck doesn't react to the hit (i.e. he just stands there, as if his opponent were punching a brick wall). Originally, this was usually a case of the wrestler taking the hit just being a dick, and was highly frowned upon because it was seen as undermining Kayfabe. But it also came to be used as a way to demonstrate that a wrestler is just that tough. Some wrestlers use no-selling as their main schtick.\\nImmunities to specific attacks and/or Standard Status Effects are almost always present in Tabletop Games and are the main purpose of Damage Typing. As a game model grows, it's more and more likely to get into Lensman Arms Race of effects, immunities and immunity-breaching effects. See also The Law of Diminishing Defensive Effort.\\nCompare Kung-Fu Proof Mook, which is when mooks do this, Punch! Punch! Punch! Uh Oh..., where the attacker uses hand-to-hand attacks instead of special powers, and Shooting Superman, for when this crosses over with Idiot Ball. Usually, this is accompanied by a Finger Wag. Also see Contractual Boss Immunity and Useless Useful Spell for related video game mechanics. See Disability Immunity for cases when the attack happens to be not applicable to the victim rather than counteracted, and Feel No Pain where the no sell is the result of the attack not being felt by the target. See also Cross-Melting Aura for a way especially evil creatures No Sell their Weaksauce Weakness to holy items. A favorite of the Implacable Man and The Juggernaut.

This applies to the audience in general; there will naturally be a different threshold for each individual.\\nThe Rule Of Cool is another principle that seeks to dispel arguments among fans over implausibility in fiction. It has been cited by animation director Steve Loter (of Kim Possible, Clerks: The Animated Series, Tarzan, and American Dragon: Jake Long) in response to questions from fans attempting to justify temporary breaches in logical consistency. It is a complement to Bellisario's Maxim and the MST3K Mantra.\\nOf scientific laws that this trope circumvents, the third law of motion is probably the most frequently revoked, with the square-cube law probably a close second. The Second Law of Thermodynamics is third and a mention has to go to the laws of relativity, which prevent us from attaining Faster-Than-Light Travel and going to a distant planet in just a few hours.\\nNote that you only get to invoke the Rule of Cool if the end product is, in fact, cool. Note also that different opinions on what is \\\"cool\\\" create the most arguments over this. The Rule of Cool is very subjective. Failure to properly use this trope can cause collision damage with walls.\\nSince it's subjective, it doesn't have to be cool in the sense of \\\"Grim reaper on a mountain playing an electric guitar\\\". The protagonist might not use guns because it's cooler to have them fight vampires with knives and stakes.

      "general": "The protagonist opens the cupboard in a haunted house and, terror of terrors, there's a rat inside. Everyone involved screams at the sight of the filthy diseased vermin. Except it looks like it's been recently bathed and brushed. And instead of fleeing or acting aggressive, it's looking expectantly at the actors for a treat. In really egregious cases it might even be white or multicolored instead of brown like a wild rat.\\nThis is a Terrifying Pet Store Rat. While the animal in question is often a rat, it also applies to spiders, snakes, and anything else the audience is expected to react with fear or revulsion toward, despite the animal reacting like a pet. Spiders will saunter calmly over people instead of racing along in a panic. Snakes will crawl onto people's shoulders, staring them in the face comically instead of hissing and coiling defensively.\\nThis is generally caused by the fact that wild animals are really hard to work with. A wild rat might panic and flee realistically, but getting it to sit still long enough for the actors to show up is a challenge, as is anything involved in moving it. And the SPCA/Humane Society/local equivalent would be likely to object, too, since there's a much higher chance of the animal or human handlers being injured, which helps no one, so this trope is a Acceptable Break from Reality when it's done for safety's sake. So as far as most directors are concerned, a tame ball python that barely moves is usually a better choice than a deadly jungle snake, especially since no one will notice the difference anyway. Strangely, this often isn't averted with CGI, as fast, complex movements are expensive to animate. Very often crosses over with Misplaced Wildlife.\\nThis is a stock feature of horror movies, they often wander in the background for ambiance, act as a Cat Scare, or provide a Why Did It Have to Be Snakes? moment when a protagonist has to get past them. In severe cases, the central threat of a horror movie may fall into this trope. The main thing making this trope is that the animal is neither threatening nor believably wild.\\nRelated to Reality Is Unrealistic, in that viewers accustomed to seeing only Terrifying Pet Store Animals on film are often shocked by how tick-ridden, mangy and scarred actual wild animals tend to be.\\nSee also Slurpasaur, a.k.a. Attack of the Fifty-Foot Terrifying Pet Store Rat."

Large chunks of history are well-documented.\\nBut for most creators of fiction, accurately depicting historical fact comes in a very distant second place to telling a good story the best they can.\\nAlso, many writers commit what's called the \\\"historian's mistake\\\", which is the idea that historical characters acted and made their decisions with full knowledge of the future \\u2014 including the repercussions their actions would cause (like for example portraying Churchill as saying his Darkest Hour Rousing Speech with knowledge that Nazi Germany was going to be defeated in 4 years). This is also known in psychology as Hindsight Bias. Although some historical individuals made predictions that came true, this is not the same thing as knowing what would happen. For instance, a character in 1919 could plausibly predict that the Treaty of Versailles would cause hardship, anger and instability in Germany (indeed, Marshal Foch himself said at the time it was \\\"not a peace treaty, just an armistice for twenty years\\\", if only because he understood it to be too lenient), but it would be stretching it for him to confidently assert that the instability would specifically result in the rise of a ruthless racial supremacist paramilitary regime in Germany that would be hellbent for revenge starting the biggest war in human history and along the way, responsible for the systematic murder of millions of Jews, Roma, and others.\\nThis trope is NOT for speculative history stories, which get a pass simply because they're supposed to be alternate history stories, unless they reference these events as parts of \\\"actual\\\" history.\\nCompare Anachronism Stew, where the inaccuracies are not fictional inventions, just details drawn from different eras; Hollywood History, where the facts are mostly right, just caricatured and stereotyped, when not subject to Nostalgia Filter; and Future Imperfect, where characters in a speculative fiction story set in the distant future get history horribly wrong.

He wants people to be happy and for good to triumph over evil, and isn't afraid of anything. His power is not based on people liking him or a hidden plan to extract the tears of mortals. If God permits evil, it is because He respects people enough to let them make their own mistakes, and deal with the consequences of their actions, rather than evil for the LULZ. If a hero is pious and noble, repentant if it concerns an anti hero, or if the evil cannot be contained by mortal agents, sometimes divine intervention actually happens, no strings attached.

This is the opposite of Have You Seen My God?, and tends to go hand-in-hand with Light Is Good.\\nIf this concerns an Anti-Hero or unbeliever, the prayer typically begins, \\\"Please, God, if you're there...\\\" This is especially poignant if the character had previously gone on a massive Rage Against the Heavens rant, or is a Hollywood Atheist. Perhaps his/her current condition isn't the fault of God, but rather from their own faults, the negative consequences of their own actions, or the actions of others.\\nFor dramatic reasons, protagonists may avoid turning to God until they've exhausted every other possible recourse: Prayer Is a Last Resort. (Bonus points if the prayer includes the line, \\\"God, I'm not really a praying man, but...\\\") This can be used to underscore how desperate the situation really is, and also to avoid any too-convenient divine interventions. More pious folks may still consider that to be a bit of Unfortunate Implications; after all, if there's really an omnipotent Big Good who's willing to give you supernatural assistance when you ask, why wouldn't you ask right away?\\nUnanswered prayers may lead to a Crisis of Faith if the characters dwell too much on the age-old question of why a good God allows evil. A possible answer may be that, although He's good, God Is Flawed. It could also be that He prefers to leave people's decisions up to them, even though that results in The Evils of Free Will. Maybe it's just that He's working In Mysterious Ways or that Helping Would Be Kill Stealing. (This is a huge discussion in Real Life theology, so we should leave it at that.)\\nCompare God of Good, which overlaps (since, in monotheistic religions, He is this also). This is the guy that the Good Shepherd and The Paladin work for. The Missionary spends his time Walking the Earth and telling people about this trope. Compare Jesus Was Way Cool for when The Son gets good ink specifically.\\nOpposite of God Is Evil, Jerkass God, and God and Satan Are Both Jerks. For a Perspective Flip, see Satan Is Good. Contrast Omniscient Morality License, when a god's claim to be good is based merely on being all-powerful. A believer who sees God's favor as something to be smug about is Egocentrically Religious.

Teachers are common targets, as are other, non-related caretakers. While having this kind of crush is more often associated with girls, it is increasingly common to portray boys as having this kind of crush. Usually, nothing ever comes of it\\u2014at least not until the character in question is much older, and even then, it still might seem a bit Squicky to some. In animation, the trope can be invoked without fully using it in the case of teenagers, where one character is only a few years younger than their crush, but differing rates of physical development makes the crush look a lot older than them.\\nAlthough it may seem to have Unfortunate Implications, this trope is Truth in Television.

      "general": "The bane of naturalists, just as Anachronism Stew is the bane of historians. This is a trope that can manifest several different ways.\\nGenerally, filmmakers use whichever animals they can get for a scene involving wild animals, especially in films set in Darkest Africa or The Amazon. Whether the animals are in the right environment, on the right continent or displaying appropriate behaviour is something they just hope we won't ask about.\\nNotorious in the case of elephants for scenes in Darkest Africa, since the only trained elephants available tend to be Indian, not African.\\nGlaringly obvious in the case of monkeys, as the cutest monkeys, the ones with the round faces and prehensile tails, are exclusive to the New World. Old World monkeys have long, wrinkly, often brightly colored faces and bare, often colourful, butts with non-prehensile (most of the macaque family and the colobus family) or vestigial (the drill and mandrill) tails, so any film in Africa, India, Asia, or the Middle East featuring a cute little monkey hanging by its tail will annoy a naturalist like a Shakespearean costume at King Arthur's court annoys an English historian.\\nAlso, scary things like snakes and spiders will consist of whatever the pet store had in stock. Never mind where these animals live. Never mind if they're even really dangerous either.\\nCan qualify as a full-fledged biology fail in cases where the animal wouldn't even be able to survive in the environment where it's depicted, never mind being in the wrong place. Fishes are perhaps the most common victims of this, as when freshwater species such as piranha or electric eels are shown living in the ocean, salinity ought to kill them in minutes.\\nMisidentified wildlife is another feature of this Trope. This tends to happen to birds a lot. Some movies show a bird making generic ambient noise type calls, usually via stock footage. This ruins any sense of immersion for birdwatchers, who will immediately ask, \\\"Hey, what's a White-throated Sparrow doing in feudal Japan?\\\" Indeed one will eventually come away with the impression that there are no birdwatchers in Hollywood.\\nOccasionally, a movie or TV show will attempt to justify Misplaced Wildlife by identifying an animal onscreen, such as that White-throated Sparrow, as something ''completely'' different - even if it's a species that looks nothing like the creature onscreen.\\nAlso, sometimes background sound effects contain sounds of animals not native to the setting of the film/TV show. Perhaps the most notorious example is the use of the distinctive \\\"laugh\\\" of the Australian kookaburra in jungle scenes set in Africa, or anywhere else other than Australia. This began with MGM's early-30s jungle movies like Tarzan, the Ape Man, and ever since, everybody has used this sound as jungle background.\\nNaturally, this trope occurs much less often when the filming actually takes place within the area where the story is set. Also, this trope generally applies only to normal animals. Funny Animals can be easily called as immigrants of some sort if found out of their element. A few cases might be explained with Creator Provincialism, as the creators incorporate the animals they're are most familiar with.\\nNote that this trope can also occur with plant life. In fact, it occurs often enough that Misplaced Vegetation is its own Sister Trope.\\nSee also Noisy Nature, Diurnal Nocturnal Animal, Artistic License \\u2013 Paleontology, Somewhere, an Ornithologist Is Crying, Somewhere, a Herpetologist Is Crying, and Polar Bears and Penguins.\\n\\nExamples"

After all, if they've made a Ferengi prosthetic for you before, they don't have to go to quite as much effort to do so again...\\nThe use of the same actor for different characters is typically intended to go unnoticed or at least unremarked.

Since that series was so intricately plotted, fans wondered if the Shadows were influencing events as far back as the pilot. No, said series creator J.

Evil Minions, Dragon, and members of the Quirky Miniboss Squad are more dependent on this trope than the Big Bad, since the Big Bad usually has enough screen time to more clearly establish their motives.\\nNazis and neo-Nazis are possibly the ultimate example of modern cinematic Villain by Default characters, since these need no additional characterization - most of society agrees Nazis were evil simply by being Nazis, and neo-Nazis are even more evil because they're the really dedicated ones (as opposed to the occasional Nazi that was conscripted).\\nOther common examples of Villain by Default types:\\n Serial killers (Unless they only kill bad people)\\n Drug dealers\\n Some drug users might also count (see \\\"People who are psychotic\\\" below)\\n Bullies (especially in school-related or Slice of Life works)\\n Necromancers\\n Racial supremacists (unless they have a really good Freudian Excuse)\\n Satanists\\n Slavers and slave-owners (unless in a society in which slavery is deeply ingrained and are shown to treat their slaves well.)\\n Tobacco company executives\\n Communists (especially for works written in the Western countries during the Cold War)\\n Even more so if they are actual KGB agents\\n Pedophiles\\n Sadomasochists\\n People who are psychotic\\n Unless they're Inspirationally Disadvantaged\\n Anyone or anything in a Sci-Fi show that claims to be a deity, even (or especially) if they have a good case.\\n Goblins, orcs, and various other monsters.

Whether this is because they are ineffective, corrupt, well-meaning-but-misinformed, or just in the protagonist's way depends on the specific story.\\nNaturally, whenever a group is cast as Villains By Default without additional justification, there will be a part of the audience that's going to disagree with the assessment. This is particularly true of works that are subtly or unsubtly pandering to one \\\"fashionable\\\" prejudice or another, or that are aimed at very specific audiences.

This can be done for several reasons: the director may be a fan of the original work, the studios may want to capitalize on nostalgia, or the writers may want to approach the original plot from a different angle. A movie is not a remake if it is based on the same source as an earlier film, such as the 1967 and 1998 versions of Doctor Doolittle, which were both based on the book series.\\nA variation on The Remake is the Foreign Remake, an English version of a foreign movie. It can be between any two countries, such as The Ring, a Japanese film remade in the US.\\nThe Video Game Remake is a subtrope of this, as is The Film of the Series.\\nTV shows can also be remade, but this is much rarer because of the tendency to instead make later series part of the same continuity as the earlier ones. When a series is remade it is often a Continuity Reboot as well.\\nIt should be noted that remakes have existed almost as long as there have been movies.\\nNot to be confused with the REmake, which is a specific example of a Video Game Remake, or the 2006 Slasher Movie The Remake.\\nRemakes are also similar to Continuity Reboots, and there is occasionally some overlap. However, one of the key differences between a straight remake and a Continuity Reboot is that anything can be remade, but only a long-running series can be rebooted. Re Tool is also often congruent with both Continuity Reboots and remakes.\\nThe terms \\\"remake\\\" and \\\"reimagining\\\" are somewhat interchangeable and fall under the same general heading, but there is a difference of degree. Reimaginings take more liberties with the original than remakes typically do, so billing a project as a reimagining is a signal that the audience should not expect it to closely follow the original.\\nA Tone Shift will often be part of the Remake, especially if it's billed as a reimagining."

      "RaidersOfTheLostArk": "Raiders of the Lost Ark is quite a bit more well known than its sequels, especially the very first scene. References to Temple of Doom and most importantly The Last Crusade do pop up infrequently, especially the latter's earlier parts. Why Did It Have to Be Snakes? indeed. (Also, It Belongs in a Museum.)",
      "general": "There's a general trend that in any serial work of a non-random medium, the further back in the series you go, the more familiar it is amongst the general populace. The culmination of this is that the very first installment (and, going even further, the first couple scenes, even) will be the one that is the most familiar by a wide margin.\\nObviously, there is some logic to this. Most people will start at the very beginning of a serial work if they can, but not nearly as many people will continue the series. Whether it be due to a lack of time, a perceived lack of quality within the work, or just finding the series not to their general tastes (or, hell, just being lazy), they'll only take in the first installment.\\nThis seems to happen most often with books. This can probably be attributed to the fact that there isn't really any type of casual market for serious works and most readers of them will have access to the first parts of the serial and generally start from there. However, sometimes the first installment won't be as widely distributed as later installments because the publisher didn't expect it to be such a big hit, so the second book is often the best-known.\\nThis also happens often with music \\u2014 where a sizable portion of the Fandom considers a band's earliest releases to be the best. As such, they are often, well, less than impressed with New Sound Albums. The Beatles, Pink Floyd and The Cure are three of the few notable exceptions. A similar but distinct trope by the name of First and Foremost exists for songs where the original rendition is the most popular despite being covered frequently by other bands.\\nVideo Games, while they don't generally fall in this trope on a per installment basis, still tend to manifest this within single installments themselves. The first sections of the game will be more well-known than any other part, with most of the coverage of the game drawing from it, since (as designers know quite well) many players do not play all or even most of the way through games.\\nThis can often get compounded when Compressed Adaptations only draw material from the first entry as well.\\nOften a form of Nostalgia Filter and Small Reference Pools. See also Contested Sequel and Sophomore Slump. Contrast Adaptation Displacement, Sequel Displacement, Early Installment Weirdness. Sometimes caused by Sequelitis.\\nNote: Please don't list aversions.

Whether they won or lost is immaterial. The important thing is that they are still alive and are so glad to be alive that they decide to celebrate the fact by doing the most lively thing of which they can think of.\\nThis can take many forms. Perhaps The Team takes a town and decided to enjoy the \\\"hospitality\\\" of the grateful female population. If the setting is a little more politically correct then it shall be made perfectly clear the female members of the group are as glad to be alive as the men are and thus they shall be more likely to seek out each others' company. As a matter of fact, this more or less defines the sex life of any Battle Couple that has gone all the way; it may constitute their Relationship Upgrade to a Battle Couple. Perhaps the Damsel in Distress doesn't think the Smooch of Victory is sufficient reward and offers Rescue Sex, especially if she, too, is glad to be alive. Many an Action Girl has become an Action Mom in the immediate aftermath of such a situation. May, in fact, lead to Babies Ever After. Can also be one of the attractions of In Harm's Way. On a darker and more disturbing note, these notions are probably a reason behind the \\\"rape\\\" part of Rape, Pillage, and Burn when a victorious army is marching into town.\\nThis trope is also Truth in Television; heightened libido is a common after-effect of surviving a dangerous and stressful situation.\\nSmooch of Victory may have to substitute, either for a G-Rated version, or because they lack the time and/or privacy.\\nSometimes overlaps with Last Minute Hookup, particularly in one shot works. Rescue Sex can be a this if either the rescuer and/or rescuee were in imminent danger beforehand. Standard Hero Reward is a Lighter and Softer version of this.

The key difference is that a living being is sucked into a jet engine and doesn't come out in pieces afterwards (unless those pieces are really, really tiny) \\u2014 it gets reduced to a Pink Mist. Likewise, a non-living object comes out in tiny shiny shreds.\\nVery definitely a Truth in Television, as the jet engines most people are familiar with are the high-bypass turbofan engines on commercial airliners, which draw in a tremendous volume of air and thus produce hurricane-force winds in the region near the engine inlet. The spinning item at the very front of the engine is a very-unforgiving ducted fan made of titanium blades spinning at thousands of RPM, which will rapidly render an animal as large as a person into something akin to liquefied beef. Ground crew that must work near active jet engines must keep anything not tied down (including themselves) some tens of meters away, outside the hazard zone, or else risk being drawn into the engine.\\nAny type of foreign object that strikes an aircraft (either the airframe or the engines) and damages it is called foreign object damage, of which the most typical type are \\\"bird strikes\\\", although ice/hail damage is also common. To a certain limit, airliners must be able to strike birds, and engines must be able to ingest birds, without causing the airframe or engine to fail. In the case of engines, this means the engine must be able to be struck by a bird up to a particular size, blend it, and pass it out the exhaust (usually by bypassing the engine's core) all without damaging the engine to the point it loses function. In essence, part of the purpose of the fandisk is specifically designed to blend objects, if only to protect the rest of the engine. It's worth pointing out that an airliner is also intended to be capable of a controlled landing with one of its engines non-functional (assuming it doesn't explode or anything), so even a larger impact might be survivable, but it's still a risk no one wants to take. In fact, larger birds such as geese have been known to damage airliner engines to the point of failure (as with the US Airways Flight 1549 incident in 2009). This is where the trope tends to deviate from reality, as typically when it is used the jet engines continue functioning with no problem whatsoever after consuming a full-sized human or more.\\nNote that the turbofan (jet) engine is so called because it contains a turbine (at the very back of the engine) which turns a fan (at the very front of the engine). The bladed disk at the front of the engine is a fan, not a turbine.\\nIt must be noted, though, that the aircraft design includes tuning airflow around aircraft so that incoming objects were drawn away from fragile parts. As result, despite dirt flying well above height of an airplane, it flies past the engine inlets. Ideally, incoming birds should be redirected away from the engines.\\nFun fact: the scientific term for remnants-of-bird from bird strike is \\\"snarge\\\", as it was probably the cleanest word to come out of the mouth of the first jet-engine mechanic to encounter it.\\nMight happen to some superheroes that fly a little too close to a plane. Especially when wearing a cape.\\nSubtrope of Deadly Rotary Fan."

      "general": "Guns are dangerous things. Extremely dangerous things. They're not just designed to hurt; they're designed to kill. With a flick of a single finger, one can take a life. Such power needs to be respected, and it shouldn't be surprising that there are various obvious safety rules in place when using a gun, that anybody who wants to use a firearm should know. Even then an expert can conceivably make a serious (and possibly fatal) mistake when handling a gun. There is even a saying among gunsmiths that \\\"There are two types of gun owners. Those who have had their guns discharge accidentally, and those who will have their guns discharge accidentally.\\\"\\nMany writers, actors, artists, and directors, however, do not know these rules. What results from this are scenes where characters are doing things they shouldn't, such as placing their fingers on the triggers of their weapons when not about to fire, or pointing their weapons at people who they are not trying to shoot; one particularly common example is foolish officers making routine arrests (e.g. drunk driving or check fraud) at gunpoint for no real reason. This is particularly troublesome when these people are supposed to be experts with lots of experience with their weapons.\\nThe distinction between this trope and Reckless Gun Usage is that this involves people who either should know gun safety based on their profession, or are stated to have extensive experience with firearms while Reckless Gun Usage involves people who are likely not familiar with basic firearm safety. If this is done for comedic purposes it's Juggling Loaded Guns. If this shows up and somebody gets shot, it's I Just Shot Marvin in the Face. If the rules are followed and somebody gets shot anyway, that's Reliably Unreliable Guns going off. Firing in the Air a Lot is always a case of this, as are Pants-Positive Safety and Gun Twirling. The trope also usually goes hand in hand with Stray Shots Strike Nothing.\\nAnother media cliche not recommended is entering a room and immediately pointing your gun forward and waving it about the room in search of potential threats as you could either drop or accidentally discharge your weapon or if there are civilians in the room, convince them that you're a hostile and cause panic. However, this is not a problem if you know there's a hostile somewhere in the building and you're trying to get rid of him.\\nMay also be the writer hinting that a character isn't as professional as he should be.\\nSee Guns Do Not Work That Way, for links to Tropes of the most common offenders.\\nNote that there is a very good reason why all of the examples here are listed under Artistic License, as trying to actually replicate any of them could lead - and has led - to accidents, many of them fatal.

If the person wants to break the victim, this may be a way to force him to say that 2 + Torture = 5, or somehow get the victim to join them.\\nMay be a Fate Worse Than Death, calling for a Mercy Kill or I Cannot Self-Terminate when the hero comes upon the victim \\u2014 the victim is likely to plead for death even if the hero can save him, but the hero is (obviously) prone to override the plea and drag him out of there, if he can. Recovery is likely to be improbably complete.\\nHeroes torture, sometimes, when they are in a great rush and dire need, and there, the effects tend to be rather unrealistic; in Real Life, torture leaves physical scars and mental trauma, and tends to have poor results in terms of getting reliable and accurate information. If the bad guys don't like getting their hands dirty, they are likely to employ a Torture Technician or Robotic Torture Device to do this for them.\\nOne motive for Better to Die Than Be Killed is to avoid this.\\nAny work that paints The Spanish Inquisition (or their nearest fantasy analogue) as bad guys will often have them engaging in some form of this on people they suspect to be heretics or worse. This general portrayal of the Inquisition is known as the Black Legend.\\nCompare No-Holds-Barred Beatdown. A \\\"light\\\" sci-fi and fantasy equivalent is the Agony Beam... but if the Agony Beam is set to \\\"Consciousness\\\" expect unpleasant results. But you never know \\u2014 sooner or later you may find a victim who likes the frights.\\nSee also To the Pain, Electric Torture, Mind Rape, Room 101, and We Have Ways of Making You Talk."

      "general": "Any situation where characters communicate with gestures and motions, usually of the hands, as opposed to using voices. This is often done specifically to avoid speaking, either because somebody present is unable to hear or comprehend a given language, because background noise drowns out any attempt at speech, or because the characters are sneaking and cannot make noise. American Sign Language (and those Sign Languages that are not American) is perhaps the perfect example, allowing deaf individuals to communicate with one another through the use of sight rather than hearing.\\nHand Signals are prevalent in reality as well as fiction. Whenever you indicate something by pointing at it, you're using a Hand Signal. Armed forces use them all the time, for convenience or stealth. Here, try it yourself: when someone approaches you, hold your hand out to them, palm-out, for \\\"Stop.\\\" You didn't actually say \\\"Stop,\\\" but the other person saw your gesture and probably knew its meaning intuitively. The \\\"Cut-Off\\\" signal, made by either pointing two fingers at your throat and waving back and forth or by drawing an extended index finger across your jugular vein, is also an example of a gesture with a universally recognized (not to say slightly disturbing) meaning.\\nThis trope is frequently played for laughs, usually through Lampshade Hanging. Instances include a character misunderstanding a signal, thinking a character is gesturing meaninglessly when they are attempting to frantically make themselves understood, and the gratuitous use of hand signals when they aren't required.\\nMiming the Cues is a subtrope where one character attempts to surreptitiously coach another using improvised hand signals.\\nThis trope is not Body Language, and does not include habitual gestures like poses and tics. Also has nothing to do with Talking with Signs, which is about writing on wooden signs. A sufficiently developed set of Hand Signals may evolve into Talking through Technique or an actual Signed Language."

      "general": "The Dragon-in-Chief serves as the de facto Big Bad of the story. Though he's nominally subordinate to the \\\"real\\\" Big Bad, he's just so much smarter, stronger or more skillful (and almost always scarier) that it's clear who's really the bigger menace. He tends to have almost no respect for the Big Bad due to their comparative lack of vision, courage or common sense. The Big Bad, for his part, either seriously or fatally overestimates The Dragon's loyalty, or is just too afraid of him to be able to do much. In a nutshell, the Dragon-in-Chief is the main villainous driving force behind the plot, even if he or she did not initiate it, to the point that the Big Bad is pushed aside or even endangered by them, and rendered less important by comparison.\\nThe defining feature of a Dragon-in-Chief is that the Big Bad's Evil Plan completely falls apart without them; essentially, the main story ends with the Dragon's defeat. The Hero turns out to be way too much for the Big Bad to handle, and The Dragon is really the only significant threat in his arsenal. Typically, he and The Hero come from the same place, the same (usually violent) world and not the kind of environment in which the Big Bad normally operates. The Dragon and The Hero may have heard of each other by reputation, brewing a rivalry between the two. Alternatively, The Hero might have been after The Dragon to begin with, such as for revenge for a past misdeed. In either case while the Big Bad might stake all his fortune and dreams in the outcome of the fight, The Dragon and The Hero see the Big Bad as nothing more than an annoyance who should stay out of the way. Often the Big Bad's only hope of survival is that these two destroy each other. Sometimes, the only way for a Big Bad to still be the main villain, is for The Dragon to have a Heel-Face Turn.\\nBecause of their disrespect, there are few straight Dragons amongst Dragons-in-Chief: They are either a Dragon with an Agenda, a more dangerous Starscream, or just a more inevitable Dragon Ascendant (and don't be surprised if they are Dragon Their Feet). The Dragon With an Agenda type will probably be using the Big Bad for his own ends, working as a mercenary to fund his own projects that usually turn out to be much more threatening (or interesting) than the Big Bad's goal.\\nIf one of the other kinds, then they will probably be complaining about how the Big Bad runs things \\u2014 typically, they think the Big Bad either lacks ambition, or is just an idiot. These ones are often junior partners in the Big Bad's business: After years of hard (but fun) living as a dangerous felon, he has found himself steady employment with the Big Bad and hopes to take over the business some day or retire on the fortune made from his latest Master Plan. This is when he starts to complain about his unambitious or just plain incompetent way of running things, though the Big Bad might retort that his way is from experience and The Dragon's ways will ultimately lead to ruin. Occasionally, their warnings turn out to be right.\\nThe most important thing is that the Big Bad is just not a significant factor if The Dragon is gone. This Big Bad must be much more manageable and less dangerous than their underling, or less likely to make a splash. The Dragon-in-Chief is either the main villain or the star of the show in his own right, and the actual Big Bad ends up relegated to supporting villain status. The Dragon can became the real Big Bad, while the theoretical Big Bad, would be moved to the position of the Evil Genius.\\nWhen a character fills this role because the Big Bad is merely absent from the main story (or simply not as important to the main character), then they are The Heavy, possibly to a Greater Scope Villain (if they're operating entirely or almost entirely on their own).\\nSee also Hypercompetent Sidekick, Non-Action Big Bad, Supporting Protagonist and especially the Big Bad Wannabe, whom Dragons-in-Chief (usually) work for.

Giant mooks usually require more effort to kill than ordinary mooks; the hero may need to land a series of nasty martial-arts blows before they sink to their knees (they don't go flying when you hit them). Sometimes they may seem too strong for the hero to kill, but then be fortunately (for the hero) caught up in a machine.\\nGiant Mooks often lead mook squads. Usually the laws of Mook Chivalry dictate that they attack alone, after their underlings have been easily dispatched.\\nIf Giant Mooks are dragons, snakes, giants, or any other sort of scary animal or dumb big villain they will usually be the Right-Hand Attack Dog, which the Hero first has to slay before confronting the Big Bad himself.\\nThe actors who play Giant Mooks in big-budget films may be well-loved as wrestlers or as Gentle Giant actors in TV shows or independent films, but they don't rate above a line or two and a violent death in a major production. If a giant mook actually receives characterization, he is The Brute.\\nVideo games, particularly Brawlers, First-Person Shooter and Third-Person Shooter games, are full of these. Many of these monsters start out as the de facto boss monster of the game's first or second episode or segment, having their strength diluted in their appearances later in the game.\\nIn videogames, compare and contrast King Mook, a boss which only has the appearance of a Giant Mook.

      "general": "Some people find apes, monkeys, and lemurs inherently amusing. Perhaps it's the fact that they mirror humanity so closely while still maintaining the visage of a wild animal, perhaps it's just easier to anthropomorphize them, or maybe people just like poop-tossing jokes? Whatever the reason, there's a cyclic period of people being fascinated by primates that always seems to take the world of fiction by storm.\\nThis has long been noted by comic book authors, who, during the Silver Age, took every opportunity to insert, turn people into, or otherwise add gorillas to a superhero story. In fact, DC Comics had a policy at the time limiting the number of \\\"monkey\\\" issues per month, to prevent everybody from doing it!\\nThis is sometimes associated with the tastes of the Lowest Common Denominator, who view the ultimate form of entertainment as a cigar-smoking chimp wearing a diaper and top hat that is riding a tricycle.\\nA chimp with a diaper \\u2014 Ha ha... Wait, we didn't imagine that until just now. Ha ha ha!\\nThis trope is named for a Superdickery.com subpage. And yes, we know it ought to be \\\"Everything's Better With Non-Human Primates\\\" too. After all, everything's also better with apes, who are technically not monkeys. The difference is actually very simple - Monkeys have tails, while apes (including chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans) don't. On the other hand the word \\\"monkey\\\" is simply funnier (unless you're addressing a certain librarian...)\\nBaboons are often used if Everything Is Worse With Monkeys, probably because they're on the large size for primates and are more than willing to display their formidable canine teeth on camera. Gorillas can work either way, because everybody knows gorillas are badass, so it depends on whether the gorilla in question is good or evil. And chimpanzees will fucking kill you if they get an opportunity. Those cute ones you see on TV? Always juveniles. The adults (particularly the males) are vicious brutes that hunt and eat monkeys... and even other troops' baby chimps. And they hunt in packs.\\nSee also Killer Space Monkey, Maniac Monkeys, and Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot (which invokes this trope quite often); also check out Everything's Better with Penguins, Turtle Power, and Everything's Better with Dinosaurs for the avian and saurian equivalents of this trope.

      "RaidersOfTheLostArk": "This is alluded to in Raiders of the Lost Ark, since both the US government and the Nazis might want to use it as a weapon (although it's more of a powerful spiritual artifact than lost technology).",
      "general": "In fiction there's often a lot of reasons why opposing factions want to develop better technology (although they only need one). While some just research and create it, others just find (or supplement their own creations with) Lost Technology. When both sides scramble to secure such caches you end up with this trope.\\nWhere the technology's being salvaged from can vary greatly depending on the setting and story;\\n Cold War (and sometimes present day) settings often have abandoned Nazi technology (and scientists). Present day settings might also treat Soviet Superscience and scientists in the same fashion. More fantastic settings might provide a similar dynamic with a Fictional Counterpart: a recently defeated faction who've left lots of technology and research lying around.\\n Salvaging technology which was left behind by Precursors.\\n A variation might involve salvaging your own technology after a disaster of some sort destroyed your ability to manufacture more of it; either by digging it from the wreckage or finding caches. Or acquiring it from neutral factions who'll only hand it over to the first bidder.\\nThe list goes on, all that matters is that both sides are struggling to get their hands on technology which they didn't develop (or build, in extreme cases) themselves. If they're merely finding the means to build their weapons (or also actively reverse engineering the technology) then it's also a Lensman Arms Race. If this is the only means of getting hold of anything then the setting is most likely a Scavenger World.\\nWhen this happens with characters rather than technology, see Sealed Cast in a Multipack. When they use technology which is technically obsolete (and often already theirs) it's Break Out the Museum Piece. When everyone's after a specific piece of technology it's a MacGuffin or Sword of Plot Advancement. If the source of the technology engineered the conflict for their own ends it's War for Fun and Profit. Compare; Gotta Catch 'Em All, Grand Theft Prototype. Particularly old technology must have had Ragnarok-Proofing and benefits from Older Is Better."

      "general": "In Real Life, white is usually the color for summer clothing, given the quality of the color that reflects all spectrums of visible light away and - as such - offers some relief from the merciless heat of the summer sun. It is not considered an ideal color for most other occasions, given how easy white cloth is to stain and how clothes that absorb heat are desirable in most other climates.\\nOf course, in the world of fiction, concerns of practicality can be (and generally are) sacrificed for those of symbolism. The Man in White is a character who goes around dressed entirely (or predominantly) in white wherever he is. The reasons for this are not important, but what it signifies to the audience is; and it just so happens that in most cases, it signifies that the character is up to no good.\\nThere's just something about a man in white that weirds people out. One possible explanation for this is that since conservative men's attire has been dark-colored for the longest time (black, charcoal, and navy), looking upon a man in white creates a sensation not unlike a color-inverted image. Another one is that since white is also the color of snow and bone, an all-white ensemble evokes sensations of coldness and death.\\nIn the US, white suits have also come to be associated with Southern plantation owners, leading to the birth of the Fat, Sweaty Southerner in a White Suit. As such, white clothing in American media can also be used to suggest pride, avarice, ambition, and questionable morality, which is why you can see so many mafiosos, drug lords, and corrupt corporate executives in such garb. For a more in-depth treatise on the subject, see this article.\\nAs such, it isn't surprising to find that most men in white in fiction are unnerving at best and eldritch abominations at worst.\\nOf course, perhaps the reason it signifies that the character is up to no good is precisely because white is supposed to signify that a character is good, since that is the colour most associated - at least in the West - with an upstanding, honest, kind, or moral person; their clothing is as immaculate and pure as their soul. Having the Man in White be a villain turns this on its head and may evoke ideas of Most Definitely Not a Villain or Suspiciously Specific Denial. They pretend to be good either because they truly believe it or precisely because they are evil.\\nOn occasion, the Man in White might actually be genuinely good (if uncannily otherworldly), as Morgan Freeman in the pic demonstrates. Sometimes, its just Exactly What It Says on the Tin and you have a genuinely nice person who figuratively wears his goody-two-shoes-ness on his sleeve. Tropes Are Not Bad, and the Man in White need not be either.\\nOther times, the color white might simply come with the position: doctors and scientists have their pristine labcoats, priests and monks don long white robes, and some military officers get white dress uniforms\\u2014or indeed service uniforms, in tropical postings (the Imperial British or French soldier/sailor in pure white and a pith helmet lording it over the natives is an iconic image of the 19th century). Since white clothing is expected of these characters, their appearance tends to impress (rather than unnerve) the audience and their fellow characters.\\nCompared to its Distaff Counterpart, the Woman in White, the Man in White is a much younger trope and not nearly as well established; as such, you'll find a broad range of characters and characterizations under the examples. All it really takes to be a Man in White is to wear white: all the added symbolism described above is just bonus.\\nNote that in Japan, men wear white tuxedos at their weddings because they think it looks Western (and it matches their bride's white wedding dress). The fact that Western grooms typically wear black is of no concern.\\nThe chromatic counterpart of The Men in Black. For other uses of the color white, see Blood-Splattered Wedding Dress, White Shirt of Death, White Hair, Black Heart, Mystical White Hair, and the more explicit about significance Gold and White Are Divine."

It's also a common game to take normal media titles and see how many porn titles they can be twisted into. Most of the times the only parody is the title. Curiously, the current hot trend in the porn industry is for high-budget, well-made parodies (well, higher-budget and better-made, anyway) that re-create what they're spoofing with careful attention to detail... but which reject parody titles in favor of just taking the original title and sticking \\\"This Ain't\\\" in front of it or \\\"A XXX Parody\\\" afterwards.\\nExamples: Star Whores (Episode IV: A New Hole), Muffy the Vampire Layer, Lord of the G-Strings, An Officer and a Gentleman and Golden Retriever, Dr. Buttlove, or; How I Learned To Stop Clenching and Love the Plug, Top Gun (I know, very clever, right?)\\nOne popular misconception is that this is standard practice in the porn industry. While it seems common, it's worth noting that it is a vast minority in the porn out there (as noted above). Most of it goes by the format of [race/gender/defining characteristic of participants] [optional fetish twist] [primary action performed] [number of series], the only fixed order generally being the number.

      "general": "In Real Life, spiders tend to be rather lonely creatures. A lot of species have females eating their males after breeding, and, in many cases, the mother herself ends up eaten by her own children once they hatch.\\nIn fiction, though, things tend to be different. Occasionally, especially in a Science Fiction or Fantasy setting, a work will depict a species of (often but not necessarly) Giant Spiders that attack in large number, or even live in colony, the same way ants, termites and bees do. They will often have a \\\"Spider Queen\\\", which they protect and which will be often much bigger than they are. And they will have eggs, a lot of eggs, that can hatch anytime, unleashing entire swarms of small spiders on you.\\nThe reason for this trope is quite obvious. Spiders Are Scary, so an entire colony of spiders will be even scarier, much more so than one of giant ants or termites. There is also the fact a spider nest can easily be imagined as filling the role of a hive for bees.\\nA very common trope in Video Games, where spiders are typically featured as small but numerous ennemies who obey to a bigger one.\\nNotice that the trope, while it can be a case of Artistic License \\u2013 Biology or Critical Research Failure, can also be, to an extent, justified if the species of spiders involved is fictional. Also, as noted in the Real Life section of this page, this trope actually is, to some extent, Truth in Television: there are species of spiders that are social, just not to the extent presented in fiction.\\nA subtrope to Giant Spider and The Swarm.

      "general": "Boosting a car from a parking lot isn't that hard, when you get right down to it. You open the door, start the ignition, and as long as no one takes note of you, you can just drive off in your shiny new stolen wheels. If you've somehow managed to nab the keys to said car, then it's even easier. And as we all know, Rule of Drama dictates that easy things are boring.\\nYou know what's cooler? Stealing a vehicle while someone's driving it, preferably at breakneck speed.\\nDepending on what kind of vehicle you're taking over, there are many ways you could pull off that stunt. A favorite of action movie heroes is to jump from one moving car to another (or from a motorcycle to a car, or a train to a car), taking down the driver (preferably by throwing him from the vehicle), and grabbing the wheel. For bonus points, let vehicles without drivers drift off, crash, and explode.\\nDon't let the limitations of your vehicle (or lack thereof) limit what you can steal. Jumping from one speedboat to another is child's play. Stealing a helicopter when you're on foot with nothing but a Grappling-Hook Pistol is better. Ramping a boat into the air and jumping from your flying boat into a helicopter? Crazy Awesome.\\nThis trick has long been a staple of action movies of all types, and not just ones where gas-powered vehicles are common. Horse-jacking or carriage-jacking are fair game for action movie period pieces, and stealing a Phlebotinum-fueled Flying Car is remarkably similar to stealing a rolling one.\\nCompare Outside Ride and Hood Hopping, which frequently precede a High Speed Hijack.

      "general": "When the hero is spared the burden of dispatching the villain because the villain engineers his own death or defeat.\\nWhile the monsters of the week have the decency to be sufficiently inhuman, anthropomorphic, faceless and irredeemably evil that the heroes feel no guilt over slaying them (so polite!), human enemies are another story. What exactly is the hero to do when he captures Cleo the Necromantess? Tell the police to arrest her for stealing chunks of Soul Anatomy from Innocent Bystanders, cursing them to endless nightmares? It's hard to prove that in a court of law. And even if a high-ranking member of the police is a Secret Keeper who can get Cleo jailed for other charges, what prison could hold her? Then there are the villains who are remorseless, sociopathic killers. You know that nothing but death will prevent Saul the Fingerchopper from killing again, but If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him...\\nWhen a hero is faced with someone who cannot be dealt with through legal channels, his morals come up hard against practical circumstances. Killing Saul is right out, but letting him go free will just result in more victims. The Big Damn Villains or a killer even more evil than Saul won't always be around when you need one, and sometimes you can't Seal Evil In A Can. The Chosen Many Corps or The Men in Black might occasionally come through and lock Saul up with their high tech/mystical imprisonment, but you can't count on that every day. And while the hero may have his powers lost/stolen every other episode, permanently Depowering a villain is rarely ever possible for an unsympathetic villain. (And let's not even get into Brainwashing for the Greater Good...)\\nSo an idealistic hero may find that the very morals he stands for are a serious hindrance to effective peacekeeping \\u2014 a tricky situation with no easy solution. This might actually be revealing a controversy in the morals \\u2014 but good luck explaining that to viewers \\u2014 or the guardians of the said morals. The hero could be in serious trouble except for one helpful fact: a human villain about to be defeated usually goes straight for the Villain Ball. Instead of begging for mercy and \\\"playing nice\\\" for a few episodes, Cleo and Saul will double down. When Saul is rescued from hanging off the cliff's edge and given a Last-Second Chance, he inevitably takes the opportunity to backstab the hero (who then reacts in self defense when he cuts Saul down). When Cleo is defeated while holding the Artifact of Doom, she will never simply drop the thing and 'surrender'. She will scream \\\"No! This Cannot Be! I just need more power!!!\\\", bringing on the Superpower Meltdown that destroys her.\\nIn short, the heroes will not have to bear the burden of killing because these villains will inevitably cause their own downfall. Their excessive egos and poor planning will turn on them at exactly the wrong moment and get them Hoist By Their Own Petard, sent to a Fate Worse Than Death, or destroyed by their own death traps. They can also take themselves out nonfatally, ending up Depowered, amnesiac, in a Convenient Coma, or trapped in a Tailor-Made Prison.\\nThe purpose of this trope is to resolve the villain's menace without going into the moral complexity of what justifies taking a human life. As such, it often appears in series where killing would be wildly inappropriate for the target audience or tone of the setting, such as works for children. When it appears in more adult fare, it is there to enable a certain kind of hero \\u2014 a Knight in Shining Armor or someone with Incorruptible Pure Pureness \\u2014 to deal credibly with Cleo and Saul without tarnishing his image.\\nConveniently, this trope also keeps the hero's secret identity secret if the villain had discovered it. The aftereffects of the Phlebotinum she was using (or even a simple Tap on the Head) will immediately make Cleo forget any damning information she may have uncovered. It might even make her forget she is a villain.\\nA big part of the appeal of this trope is that it makes for a smooth but satisfying resolution. Once Saul has dispatched himself, the hero and his party can walk to the nearest Burger Fool and order a Delicious Extra Meaty without feeling the slightest pang of guilt (well, except maybe over the empty calories in the fries). If they're particularly Nice Guys, they might feel a little sad that Saul got himself killed/trapped/disposed of \\u2014 but whatever; it's not like he won't be back in the next episode anyway.\\nCompare Disney Villain Death, which similarly disposes of a villain for good while leaving the hero's hands clean. If you were looking for the trope about a literally self-disposing body, see No Body Left Behind.\\nAs a Death Trope, all Spoilers will be unmarked ahead. Beware."

Either the characters were mislead and there never was a treasure to begin with, or the treasure used to be there but is long gone.\\n The treasure turns out to be something that has only sentimental, intellectual, spiritual, or philosophical value to those that originally owned or created the treasure. If the villain and the hero are competing for the same treasure, the villain will almost certainly fail to appreciate the value of the treasure, while the hero may in fact find something worthwhile in the treasure.\\nIf the treasure is mainly just the incentive for competition between the hero and the rival, it's just your standard issue MacGuffin, though of course it could end with No MacGuffin, No Winner. Might involve All That Glitters, if the object appears to be valuable but is really worthless. If it has sentimental value to a particular character, it is Number One Dime. If the characters find something valuable but discard it to ignorance, stupidity or possibly not being from Earth, it's a case of Worthless Yellow Rocks.\\nRelated to the Shaggy Dog Story, for obvious reasons. But if the characters gained more from the experience of looking for the treasure than they do from the value of the treasure they end up with, It's the Journey That Counts.

Sometimes a character will just yell that \\\"There's only ten seconds left!\\\" and the heroes will prevent the calamity 25 seconds later.\\nA variation is a fuse or Powder Trail which burns slower or faster when the camera's not on it. Another common visual equivalent is the falling object or descending gate which is accelerating down at something. The shot cuts just before it hits to people trying to stop it or get out the way. When the camera goes back, the thing will mysteriously have farther to fall than it did before the cut, just enough to allow the characters to make a narrow escape.\\nThis can be handwaved by arguing that part of the fight scene (since rarely are there splitscreens showing the fight and the timer) started when or before the last shot of the timer was shown, thus, the fight and the countdown are happening at the same time chronologically but are shown separately to build tension and suspense (an editing technique known as \\\"cross-cutting\\\").\\nWhen applied to a Timed Mission in Video Games, it becomes Always Close (and when applied to non-timed missions in video games, Take Your Time). See also Exact Time to Failure, which may give us the countdown in the first place, and Instant Cooldown or Magic Antidote for the miraculous events that occur when it is stopped. May be also applied to a Descending Ceiling or when The Walls Are Closing In - the crusher keeps conveniently moving back between shots. Compare Clock Discrepancy.\\nIn instances where it's not a timer that's out of proportion, but rather the speed at which off-screen travel is conducted, see Traveling at the Speed of Plot.\\nOften occurs because Talking Is a Free Action.\\nContrast Real Time. Compare On Three."

When the original German dub was created in 1981, they for some reason screwed up and created a really bad Dolby Stereo mix and managed to lose the original German speech tapes. Due to the bad production of the mix, it proved impossible to separate the speech from it to create a new 5.1 mix (as done with Star Wars) and they were forced to create a new dub in 2009 when the movie went HD, where apart from the voice of Indiana Jones, all voices were new. The old dub is well-loved and the new one caused enormous bad blood, so bad indeed that Paramount decided right away when creating the Blu-Ray that both dubs should be available on it. Thankfully, the sequels had much higher production quality in the dubs and they were spared this fate as a re-mix was trivial (access to 6-channel magnetic sound made it easy).\\n The exact same thing happened in Italy too, except that the Italian redub changes Indiana's voice too... weird thing, since the original voice actor was still available (and came back on the character for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull too).",

Perhaps some new company got the rights and can't use the previous group's resources due to some licensing hell. Perhaps the previous dub wasn't kept around to be reused again.\\nA lot of times, different English dubs are made for different international audiences \\u2013 sometimes to go along with an alternate-language dub in the same region; for instance, different English dubs for North America vs Europe or Asia. In these cases, there is an attempt to prevent even the knowledge that other dubs exist from being in the hands of the common audience. This doesn't always work.\\nFor some reason, a lot of alternate dubs tend to not get released in a home video format, and thus fall into obscurity. If that isn't the case, then it may lead to odd scenarios where two of what is basically the same program are in direct competition.\\nThis trope does not cover fan-made material, so no Abridged Series or fandubs here.\\nSince a few dubbing companies actually make multi-language dubs for the sake of covering the languages available in that region, that'd probably cover a different trope and wouldn't apply here. This also doesn't cover different variations of the same dub (like when certain lines are redubbed for television broadcast for content reasons).\\nNOTE: When possible, please note which people and companies did the duelling dubs, to prevent confusion and to clarify that the examples are examples."

Often found in the form of a Reaction Shot as the reacting characters' expression (or lack thereof) can serve as a commentary on the action, the character, or the world they inhabit. Sometimes combined with Blood Spattered Innocents, as the gore splatters on or near them.\\nA Japanese variation of this trope involves seeing the silhouettes of the participants from behind a translucent washi screen, typically a shouji sliding door, on which the blood gets spattered. The form has since been widely adopted by the west and is often used to give a sense of art. A similar variation is to have the splatter hit the other side of a pane of glass or a window. Another variation shows blood seeping out under a door, through an opening or across a sill or a threshold to imply that violence has occurred on the other side.\\nA Gory Discretion Shot can serve to keep the rating PG-13 to reach a wider audience. It may also be done for budgetary reasons: red dyed corn syrup splashed over a window: cheap. Showing someone's head explode: expensivenote\\u00A0Although Scanners managed an effective budget version by filling a rubber head with chicken giblets and blood and firing a shotgun at it from below and behind. Still more expensive than the syrup/dye, though. Note that it could also be done to keep the truth hidden from the viewer. Showing the murder in question straight out, so the viewers can see the culprit, doesn't make a good murder mystery in most shows or movies after all.\\nCombine it with Bloodless Carnage, and you get the Sound-Only Death \\u2014 the audience hears the gunshot and the body hitting the deck, but what they see is (for instance) the victim's hat falling to the ground with a hole through it. Or the killer walks through a door and we hear gunshots and screams after it closes behind him. Also crosses paths frequently with Scream Discretion Shot.\\nA related trope is the camera cutting away when things get nasty. Say if someone is getting whipped, we'll only see their face contorting in pain. Alternately, a cut similar to a Screamer Trailer may be used, showing a split second worth of the carnage. In the same vein, the aftermath of a murder may be demonstrated minimally with a Dead Hand Shot, hopefully one still attached to the body.\\nContrast Gorn. Compare and contrast Battle Discretion Shot and Nothing Is Scarier; though this may be less \\\"scary\\\" than not showing anything at all in a less overtly violent work, in Gornographic works this can be used for horror\\u2014with all this overt violence running around, what is so horrible you don't get to see it...?

Well, you could have him/her abuse a cute little animal \\u2014 or have him/her sexually molest the helpless Damsel In Distress or momentarily disabled Action Girl or Distressed Dude when she/he is at his/her mercy. This can include Terms of Endangerment, unwanted kisses, licking, sniffing, groping, Traumatic Haircut, dressing him/her in skimpy clothing, or even out-and-out trying to rape her/him \\u2014 though this last one is usually stopped before it gets too far, as the hero generally shows up in time to rescue her/him or she/he finally gets the chance to regain advantage. In shows with a historical/fantasy setting, it can also include attempts to force the heroine/hero into marriage.\\nThis trope is used for two purposes: to emphasize how utterly depraved the villain is, and/or to add a sense of urgency to the hero's efforts to rescue his true love. In the meantime, expect her/him to react with either angry defiance (possibly involving brandishing a Chastity Dagger) or silent, shuddering disgust (no one ever seems to play along in the hope of avoiding more serious harm). Bonus points if the villain is grotesquely ugly/deformed and has a habit of snarling things like \\\"Aha! I have you now, my pretty!\\\" Another stock phrase, which seems to be more popular with Mooks, is \\\"I like a girl with spirit!\\\"\\nThis trope has been a staple of movies ever since the early days of cinema, but it's a lot older than that. There are several examples in William Shakespeare's works \\u2014 most notably, of course, The Rape of Lucrece, and others going back to Ramayana. Almost always involves a male villain and female victim; the few gender-reversed or same-sex examples tend to play it for comic effect. However, don't forget that Villainesses Want Heroes and if a villainess wants a male Sex Slave or a consort, this is just what might happen if The Hero is unwilling to wed or bed her, especially if he's too weakened to fight his way out. Other exceptions to the Black Comedy effect are usually seen in Boys Love series and Slash Fics where it's treated as a fodder for easy wangst and hurt comfort. (Or Fetish Fuel, in some cases.)\\nAn alternative to this trope involves a villain not performing this action even when the opportunity obviously presents itself. This can prove an obvious follow-up to showing a villain as being either a Worthy Opponent or prepping them for a Heel-Face Turn. In either case, the heroine might not be relieved at his disinterest. Heck, she may even be offended.\\nCompare the Scarpia Ultimatum. A Gilded Cage may be employed to \\\"sweeten the deal\\\" for the captive, or the villain may use mind control to get her to cooperate quickly. Something like this is usually on the mind of anyone who orders his Evil Minions to Bathe Her and Bring Her to Me. Also very likely to happen to someone who's Alone with the Psycho.\\nSee also: Villain Ball, And Your Little Dog Too."

      "general": "A Deadly Fireworks Display occurs whenever a character dies in a slow and occasionally agonizing way that is worked out to be as flashy as possible. What will generally happen is that bright colors will appear during a death scene and that said bright colors will create a dazzling show akin to a fireworks display (hence the trope name). Circumstances can be however they are for the death of a character, but it counts as a Deadly Fireworks Display if the death is either directly accompanied or caused by a light show. The show is also there to show us that the character met a generally unpleasant end, be it a good or bad guy.\\nOftentimes this trope occurs as a result of a Deal with the Devil, and the death itself is caused by the spirits of the one whom the deal was made with when they are unable to pay up. Said spirits thus make it a point to make his death as flashy as possible, with plenty of flashing lights supposedly representing Black Magic as the character is dragged to their doom.\\nThe trope can also be used when someone is Sealing Evil in a Can, in which case it does not count as a death so much as it does a sealing. In the case that the light show occurs as a result of Tricking the Shapeshifter, it can be tied in to A God Am I, although some examples don't do this.\\nYet other times, it involves the Big Bad directly if said Big Bad is a supernatural entity like a spirit or a god. In these cases, Tricking the Shapeshifter is not entirely necessary; if it dies, it will simply die in a light show.\\nSubtrope of Technicolor Death, the key difference being that the death is always flashier than most Technicolor deaths really are. (For example, the Wicked Witch of the West would count as a Technicolor death, but it's not flashy enough to count as a deadly fireworks display.)

Not being an elaborate plan of disposing enemies, the sealed room is usually more of an opportunistic ploy \\u2014 the good guys have gone into an abandoned mine or ancient crypt or isolated cave of their own volition, and the villain just takes this lucky chance to seal them in forever. Of course, forever turns into the twenty minutes or so it takes the hero to find an alternate way out, or occasionally to be rescued. Sometimes the stakes are raised by having the room slowly fill with water or gas.\\nThe quiet solitude of this trap can be used to effect a Locked in a Freezer plot between two characters.\\nSometimes the tension of this Deathtrap is increased by use of a good old-fashioned slowly-sealing door, which the good guys fail to squeeze through at the last second, or using a very small and unventilated space like a bank safe where the trappee will theoretically soon run out of air.\\nThis trope might have roots in the Greek myth of Antigone, who performed funeral rites for her dead brother - a traitor to the state - and was sentenced to death by her uncle, King Creon. The death sentence was, simply, being sealed in a cave to die of hunger/dehydration. In the play by Sophocles, Creon later had regrets, but when he tried to let her out she had already hanged herself (It is a tragedy, what did you expect?).\\nThis trap is often encountered in Medieval settings \\u2014 the original Oubliettes were cellar rooms at the basement of the heaviest fortified tower in the stronghold, called the donjon (hence dungeon, an alternative spelling) with access only through a trap door at the upper floor.\\nSee also Tailor-Made Prison and Closed Circle.

See Mix-and-Match Weapon for when swords and guns, along with other weapons, are fused together into a weapon that will be cooler than both but may or may not work.

      "RaidersOfTheLostArk": "A similar tale is told of dealing with the monkey in Raiders of the Lost Ark, which took a violent dislike to the actor playing its best buddy in the movie.",
      "general": "In fiction, wild animals rarely act the way that they do in real life. Those hilarious Plucky Comic Relief chimpanzees and their hilarious antics? Never once do they get violent, no matter what (they may get mad for the hero's benefit, though). When animals do get mad, they're usually easily calmed down if just given whatever MacGuffin is necessary. Is a bear rampaging through town? Just give it some honey and everything will be OK. Being a Friend to All Living Things can help, but surprisingly often it seems like nearly anyone can calm down a wild animal.\\nPart of the cause of this is simply that animal sidekicks are really adorable (and loyal wild animal companions are cool in itself), but most of the more interesting ones are not of domesticated species, and the only rational way for the hero to get one is from the wild. Taming an adult animal is far more trouble than it's worth. Even taming a baby one never does much for softening its wild instincts. (Incidentally, reptiles are not actually domesticated; they adjust to captivity well given the right temperatures and food, but can't really be trained and are often unpredictable.)\\nAnother strong factor is the huge number of YouTube videos available showing 'wild' foxes (red white and yellow) canines (coyotes, dingos, hybrids of all types) and smaller cats (up to lynx size, though you do find the occasional cougar) living in apparent domestic tranquility. There are also an increasingly large number of wildlife sanctuaries where you can go along and 'pet a wolf'. Again, most people tend to miss that these animals only behave like pets around people they know, usually have their own 'play/sleep room' (that they trash) and are extremely difficult/expensive to look after. The domestication is usually only partial and not hereditary, and you're only seeing the successful cases. That ambassador wolf who shoves his head into your lap and rolls over begging for you to pet his tummy? Almost certainly 50% of the animals at such places would simply run away if given the chance, and 90% of the rest will eventually bite you. The keepers picked this one for a reason.\\nUnfortunately, there are a depressing number of people who think this is Truth in Television and are apparently under the impression that nature is just a bigger version of Disneyland. This usually does not end well...\\nNote that \\\"domesticated\\\" means \\\"genetically-altered to meet human needs\\\", not \\\"tamed\\\". Until very recently, this meant intentional or unintentional selective breeding. A feral housecat is domesticated, but a trained bear is not. Also, there are some animal species that can be somewhat successfully tamed or trained if not entirely domesticated, usually due to a combination of small size (meaning even if they do act out they generally aren't threatening to teen or adult human life), intelligence (meaning training can be successful), and/or partial breeding for those traits and friendliness to humans. Some good examples would be most small rodents (mice, also including rats/prairie dogs/gophers/squirrels/small moles if raised from birth by humans and trained, though their natural instincts to dig and hoard need to be accounted for), skunks (if deodorized + spayed/neutered + vaccinated against rabies and having been raised with humans from birth), and some small monkeys (in their case, if raised properly alongside humans, which means no fear-based training, raising/training much as one would a human baby/toddler), with the one larger example being some wolf-hybrid dogs (those that have docility and intelligence bred as traits). Of course, most of these, with the exception of small rodents like mice, require specialized training for their trainers/owners as well in how to train and care for them, so you can't just go and pet a wild skunk or let your female dog mate with a wolf at random or bring that monkey stealing oranges from the fruit stand into your home, either.\\nCompare All Animals Are Dogs, which is about non-canine animals exhibiting doggy mannerisms. Also see Domesticated Dinosaurs for what happens when this trope is combined with Everything's Better with Dinosaurs. Contrast Everything Trying to Kill You."

Or for the political community, like... Geneva. And in some places, there is a landmark. Such as Geneva.\\nA few of these landmarks, in various locations around the globe, are so well-known by so many people that they've come to function as a sort of visual shorthand for the city, sometimes the country, in which they're located to the point where some footage of the landmark in question must be portrayed on the screen, even when that landmark is irrelevant to the plot and nowhere near where the characters are supposed to be. The National Mall in Washington, DC, Westminster Palace (specifically, its clock tower housing Big Ben) in London, the Taj Mahal in India, St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow (occasionally mistaken for the nearby Kremlin), the Sydney Opera House in Sydney... When these locations are portrayed in a film or TV show, expect numerous, panoramic establishing shots of the landmark in question. Occasionally, these landmarks will be visible out of windows or from rooftops where viewing them in real life would be geographically impossible, or in historical settings when they weren't actually built yet.\\nIconic structures such as these can also function as Red Shirts. If they are ever destroyed, then circumstances have become dire indeed. Which naturally means that in a disaster movie, the landmark in question will probably be doomed to certain destruction. The remainder of the Hollywoodland sign in California and the Statue of Liberty are popular targets for CGI catastrophes. Alternatively, the structure will be one of the few things left intact After the End, either mostly undamaged, to give the characters some kind of hope for the future, or nearly collapsed, as a testament to how much has been lost.\\nThis trope is not simply here to list various landmarks around the world, but rather instances of landmarks in fiction used as a shortcut to showing either where the action occurs or how bad things have gotten.\\nCan overlap with both Scenery Gorn and Scenery Porn, depending on how lovingly and lavishly the landmark in question is filmed.

Conversely, we should expect goodness to be more, well, user-friendly? Less liable to reduce you to a pile of ashes for looking at it crosswise?\\nDon't count on it.\\nEven when Light Is Good, it can still be too hot to handle.

Maybe it's really temperamental, and objects violently to being used for any but the most noble causes. Maybe it's just that light burns, and enough holiness in one place is naturally dangerous to anyone, not just the wicked. In any event, you'll probably rest easier with some safe distance between yourself and anything really holy.\\nThis may be the logical extreme of White Magic. While Black Magic involves drawing power from others, and has a tendency to kill or corrupt anyone, White Magic generally helps others through self-sacrifice and purges evil. Think about the implications of this: purging evil can range from the depraved villain to the Noble Demon to even an Anti-Hero. Another way to think about is thus: If you aren't willing to make the sacrifice, you get punished, while if you are worthy enough, you get sacrificed. Likewise, anyone helped by your sacrifice is likely to be saved or punished by its effects.\\nClosely related to Holy Hand Grenade; the distinction is that this trope refers to holiness being inherently dangerous to Muggles, whereas Holy Hand Grenade is when holiness is weaponized. Sometimes manifests as Cast from Hit Points or Brown Note. See also Humans Are Flawed for a possible reason Holy Is Not Safe.

Bonus points if the gunman's fall out of frame dramatically reveals the shooter behind him.\\n The bad guy two feet to the left of the hero topples over dead, because the gunman was a good guy after all, or has just come to some kind of understanding with the hero and is now their ally. Or, of course, it was The Blofeld Ploy. Can be used a subversion where the gunman just misses.\\nNot to be confused with Staged Shooting. See also Framed for Heroism.

      "general": "A Secret Government Warehouse is where a nation keeps various items whose existence should be kept secret from the general populace. Usually run by an Artifact Collection Agency.\\nIn fiction, the Secret Government Warehouse is a plot device used for conveniently disposing of story elements that have fulfilled their purpose in a story, but that would cause consistency or continuity problems for subsequent (or previous) stories in the same fictional setting were they to remain. In many cases, the story items disposed of are of such a nature that they would make it difficult to set up the necessary tensions and conflicts for other stories in the fictional setting, as they would make such tensions and conflicts simple to resolve. A secondary purpose of the Secret Government Warehouse plot device is to satirize the ineptitude of governments, the premise being that if a government found itself in possession of an extraordinary object or person, it would simply catalog it and lose it in a vast filing system.\\nOccasionally, a Secret Government Warehouse can serve as the main setting for a story. In this case, the warehouse has a rather different purpose in the story (even though its in-universe purpose is the same), that of providing a unique setting with a steady influx of phlebotinum and other weirdness.\\nSome conspiracy theorists believe that Secret Government Warehouses exist in Real Life, containing suppressed inventions, archaeological and historical evidence that contradicts mainstream theory, and objects that have famously been lost.\\nA sub-trope of Black Site. Not to be confused with Abandoned Warehouse, even though the two can overlap.\\nCompare with:\\n Area 51: Frequently overlaps with Secret Government Warehouse, as their functions are similar.\\n Bazaar of the Bizarre: If the contents of the Secret Government Warehouse were on sale, it would be a Bazaar.\\n Magical Library: Like the Warehouse, but keeps lost or forbidden knowledge rather than items.\\n Museum of the Strange and Unusual: Smaller, more intimate version of the Warehouse, generally run by a single Collector of the Strange rather than an Artifact Collection Agency. Less of an emphasis on secrecy, though it can be just as hard to find.\\nContrast with:\\n Trophy Room: A small, personal collection of mundane items.\\n Superhero Trophy Room: A small, personal collection of not-necessarily-mundane items that is kept by a superhero."

While The Omniscient Council of Vagueness doesn't seem to do much but sit around and wait while spouting off cryptic nonsense, they've got to have some sort of hidden agenda to hide or there isn't much of a point.\\nSo they've got to have a plan; an evil plan. Otherwise there's not much of a story, is there?. This trope is the reason Villains Act, Heroes React; the villain needs to be doing something evil or the hero has no evil to thwart.\\nSome popular examples of Evil Plans:\\n Take Over the World: Of course! This is the most popular villainous scheme of all. The scale of conquest can vary depending on the setting \\u2014 some warlords are content to settle with conquering a kingdom or nation, while Science Fiction or Fantasy overlords will go for nothing less than galactic, universal or even multidimensional domination.\\n The Evils of Free Will is a popular means to this end: by robbing everyone of their free will, they will have no choice but to serve their rightful ruler!\\n Earth-Shattering Kaboom: Why take over the world when you can blow it up? Like Take Over the World, the scale of destruction also varies depending on the setting \\u2014 some villains are content with merely destroying a city or kingdom (particularly if they feel the city or kingdom has somehow wronged them \\u2014 see Vengeance Is Mine), while Omnicidal Maniacs may well wish nothing less than to destroy the entire universe or multiverse.\\n Kill All Humans: No one's going to miss the little bastards, right?\\n Omnicidal Maniac: Why stop with just the humans?\\n The End of the World as We Know It: Not so much destroying the world or humanity as really screwing up civilization; though the former two may be involved in the bargain.\\n A God Am I ': Force everyone to acknowledge your godhood! (god-like powers optional).\\n Immortality Seeker: Pursue the quest for eternal life, no matter what foul deeds are needed to make it happen.\\n MacGuffin: Steal an ancient artifact with untold powers. This is usually done in the pursuit of one of the other Evil Plans.\\n Sealed Evil in a Can: Release the source of all Evil from its prison. This rarely goes well for the villain attempting it.\\n Revenge: You know that guy that wronged you in the past? It doesn't matter how petty or misplaced your grievance is, it's payback time! Time to kill the bastard, or make his life a living hell!\\n Get Rich Quick Scheme: If you're already rich, get richer. Any scheme is fair game in the pursuit of the profit margin, be it theft, blackmail, or auctioning the world off to hungry demons. Unfortunately, this lust for wealth falls prey to poor planning.\\n Utopia Justifies the Means: You know how people keep hurting themselves and each other? Make them stop, by whatever means are necessary. No ill will required! Just like in Take Over the World, The Evils of Free Will often gets put into play here.\\n Dystopia Justifies the Means: People hurting each other? That's exactly what your society needs! Use all the means at your disposal to create a nightmarish dystopia where the forces of evil run rampant and people live in constant terror and corruption.\\n Poke the Poodle: ...Wait, what?\\nNormally, these are accomplished with Stock Evil Overlord Tactics. Most of the smaller-scope plans can usually be accomplished in a less grandiose fashion but super villains often have Complexity Addiction.\\nCan involve a Xanatos Gambit but ONLY if the Evil Plan is arranged so that whatever the heroes do helps the villain in some way.

They'll ask him a simple direction or question, but the French Jerk refuses to answer, starts insulting or threatening them and/or feels they are beneath him.\\n2) French Cuisine Is Haughty: Characters visit a French restaurant, where the cook and/or the waiter are all arrogant, badly tempered and dirty snobs who refuse to give their clients what they want or interpret everything they say as a complaint. If they deliver the meals the food will always be filthy, disgusting or cold.\\n3) Characters meet a rich Upper-Class Twit, who happens to speak Gratuitous French in order to appear tr\\u00E8s chic and looks down upon the others because they are out of his noble league. A lot of comedy will be built around the fact that he or she doesn't understand or care for the common people and is unable to speak the language of the protagonists correctly. To top it all off he/she will wear or carry a lorgnette, a monocle or a small handkerchief, to emphasize his/her snobbishness. In the end he or she will always be humiliated or put in her place. This Stock Character can be found in a lot of countries who were conquered/colonized by the French or dominated by a French elite in the past, such as Belgium.\\n4) Characters meet an arrogant Frenchman full of Misplaced Nationalism, either in their country or in France. He acts as The Rival to The Hero and will start a discussion about whose country is better, either in dialogue or through some sort of competition, such as a sport tournament. After the conflict is resolved, however, he often will have grown to love the country of The Hero and isn't as arrogant about himself or his country as he was before. This follows after he is defeated or after any interaction between them that resolves the conflict.\\n5) In the USA in particular the French jerk will be portrayed as an ungrateful coward, whom the brave Americans saved in World War One and Two, but who has no respect for Americans in modern times. This is a somewhat one-sided caricature, because the French have in the past battled German invaders more than once (Franco-Prussian War (1871), for instance) and during their so-called unheroic retreat in World War Two the French only surrendered because the Nazis had already surrounded Paris and threatened to blow the city up. The French resistance did a lot during both World Wars to sabotage the Nazis' plans, when the USA was still remaining neutral during both conflicts. And some people ought to be remembered of a certain conflict that took place during the late 18th century, in which a resistance movement only managed to overcome their military occupiers with the help of another foreign power, who not only supplied and financed their operations, but also became essential in securing a decisive, final outcome to the conflict.\\nThis is more of a Characterization Trope, unlike, say, Eagle Land or Cheese-Eating Surrender Monkeys.

      "general": "The human skeleton is pretty tough. If you drink a lot of milk and get plenty of sunshine, your bones can grow to be stronger than concrete*\\u00A0By weight, anyway. A pound of bone is stronger than a pound of concrete, but only just.; shattering a bone requires a really, really strong hit, as in \\\"crashing your car at 60 km/h\\\"-strong. Did you know that crematoria actually grind bones because otherwise the fragments could be too big to fit in the urns?\\nBut a lot of science fiction writers seem to think that the skeleton is absolutely impervious to any weapon. Hit 'em with Energy Weapons (especially Disintegrator Rays), fry 'em with electricity, dunk 'em in acid, all that will be left is a skeleton. If it's technology that does it, the resulting skeleton is usually bleach white like a medical grade demonstration. If magic, the resulting skeleton is normally old and dusty. The skeleton will also typically still be joined together perfectly, even if all the sinews and tissues that hold it together have been destroyed. Almost like it's some kind of prop or something.\\nArguably, of course, the bones are the hardest and densest structures in the human body (the jaw and teeth especially) so it would make sense that the skeleton would be the last body part to be destroyed. Of course, when whatever substance that has disintegrated the rest of the body has also been known to destroy much tougher substances, it goes from being understandable to an expected Sci-Fi trope.\\nAlso occurs in fantasy settings.\\nThe purpose of this trope, of course, is shock-effect rather than realism: i.e. to visibly communicate the fact that the person is really dead, since their simply disappearing wouldn't have nearly the same impact as seeing them instantly turned into The Grim Reaper's twin brother. Meanwhile, at the same time it's \\\"cleaner\\\" and less gruesome to show a person turned into a Halloween-type skeleton than the blood-and-gore of nastier deaths, while likewise being more devastating since it would obviously take more of an impact to strip someone to the bones than simply gouge the flesh. A variant of this trope is to have a person be reduced to a skeleton, let them stay like that for a few seconds, and then have the skeleton disintegrate or collapse.\\nCompare X-Ray Sparks, when someone's skeleton is briefly visible through their skin. Occasionally, that trope may cross over with this one.\\nThis might be part of why people are Made of Iron. Also, compare Made of Plasticine; here, everything but the skeleton appears to be. See also Robotic Reveal.\\nNot to be confused with Shameful Strip, where a person is forcibly stripped to the skin, but is at least allowed to keep that.\\nAs this is a Death Trope, beware of spoilers."

      "general": "A Hollywood Torch is a piece of wood about a foot and a half long, the end of which burns brightly. It emits no significant smoke and never burns out. It tends to produce just enough light to fully illuminate a room, no matter the size, unless of course there's something horrible in a corner that we're not meant to see just yet. In some cases they can provide enough light to cast their own shadow, despite this being physically impossible.\\nEven if they've been abandoned in a dilapidated temple for a thousand years, Hollywood Torches burst into cheery flame at the slightest spark, without ever spreading this flame to their surroundings- unless intended to do so. Don't expect them to consume all the oxygen in the air, either, unless the plot demands it. In other words, they're ordinary torches suffused with improbable traits of convenience.\\nSome elements of this trope have their origins in simple filmmaking limitations: the audience (and the film crew) have to be able to see some of what is going on or else things are just going to be messy. If there's no plausible reason for someone to have a flashlight, or if firelight makes for better ambiance, this is practically your only other recourse.\\nThis trope is nearly omnipresent in film and television, such that lampshades are still rare (and who puts a lampshade on a torch anyway?). However, it may or may not be present in any particular video game, depending on whether the torches serve as part of a puzzle or other challenge. If averted, expect them to burn far quicker than their Real Life counterparts.\\nPeasants are uncannily skilled at acquiring them in massive numbers on short notice.\\nTransatlantic translation note: If a British/Commonwealth person says 'torch' they might mean the flaming kind or they might mean what an American or Canadian would call a 'flashlight' (if clarification is ever needed, the latter is an electric torch)."

      "general": "In works of fiction, guns behave in strange ways. Often, and especially in gritty action films and old-timey westerns, guns seem to fire not bullets but death itself. Mooks, Red Shirts, heroes, and Big Bads alike can die instantly from a single bullet fired in their general direction, and the kill may even be bereft of blood. In some works, this is employed slightly more realistically with bloody headshots, but are just as instantly deadly as their weakly aimed counterparts.\\nIn some works, this end is saved for mooks and actual villains, while a hero gets the benefit of a long, painful Dramatic Death complete with tears and sad music. Don't be surprised, though, if an instant death bullet finds its way to the hero's skull in the end just for shock value.\\nThis trope is largely responsible for the tendency of mooks and red shirts to come from the Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy. If the hero or villain were killed or critically wounded early on in the story, it would have a drastic effect on the story's outcome. Additionally, heroes and villains alike may just be wearing Plot Armor to avoid being shot at only until their part in the story is completed.\\nContrast Only a Flesh Wound and Almost Lethal Weapons where instead of instant death, gunshot wounds are merely inconvenient. There is also Rasputinian Death and Made of Iron. Often goes hand-in-hand with Bloodless Carnage.

      "general": "She likes sports, beer, cars, swearing, fighting and sex. She is crude, rude, often hygienically challenged and cheerfully ignorant and aggressive. If you are a guy, she'll probably challenge you to a fight or a drinking competition, win both and then take an aggressive lead in anything sexual that happens, before kicking you out the front door the following morning or teasing you mercilessly if she lets you stay some more.\\nIn short, she is a young woman with the personality of a frat boy. She is the Lad-ette.\\nDespite (or perhaps because of) their masculine personalities, Lad-ettes are generally heavily sexualised and are not likely to let any males in the company forget they are female. They usually disdain the hassle of highly elaborately feminine clothing/hair/makeup, but don't often dress in a truly cross-dressing way; Tank-Top Tomboy is a common Lad-ette style. They are also generally attractive; a genuinely ugly Lad-ette is very unusual. Male characters may well be sexually interested in Lad-ettes for various reasons, whether it's appreciation of their masculine personality and interests, because they don't disapprove of laddish behaviour, because Lad-ettes have lower body modesty and a more practical attitude than more \\\"ladylike\\\" women and hence show more skin, or simply because of their assumed willingness to engage in casual sex. In turn, a Lad-ette can be utterly shameless in exploiting male sexual interest for her own personal advantage.\\nSometimes, this woman's personality is explained by her having grown up with brothers or been raised as a boy.\\nAlso note that The Lad-ette in fiction not uncommonly winds up dropping her lifestyle in favour of something more conventional. It is difficult to tell whether this is Truth in Television or not, given how relatively recent the character type is, but there is probably at least an element of wishful thinking at play.\\nCompare and contrast with other tropes about women who look/behave in a traditionally \\\"masculine\\\" way: the Tomboy (she might have been one when young); Bifauxnen (where the girl can effectively pass as a male - though ironically while lacking most of the 'masculine' behaviour of the Ladette); Pirate Girl; and her grandmother, who shares some of her mannerisms and points of view, but retains a more feminine image: The Flapper. Also compare the Butch Lesbian, with which this trope may or may not overlap. If that hot girl is acting like a guy because she's not 100% girl, it's a case of Everybody Wants the Hermaphrodite. Sometimes, especially in anime and manga, one of these gets teamed up with a more-refined masculine-acting character.\\nAlso compare her female drinking mates, the Hard-Drinking Party Girl and the Lady Drunk. And, for the ideologies for and against her, see Girls Need Role Models, Real Women Don't Wear Dresses and Vasquez Always Dies. The Squadette may also be a Lad-ette, but it's not a job requirement.\\nA Gender Bender plot (especially via a \\\"Freaky Friday\\\" Flip) can often result in a girl with a literal masculine personality who acts much like a Lad-ette.\\nContrast with Yamato Nadeshiko and Proper Lady; two ideals of feminine beauty (Eastern Asia and Western Europe, respectively.) Also contrast with the Iron Lady, a similarly masculine woman with a very different personality.\\nDue to the \\\"frat boy in a girl's body\\\" nature of this trope, the Lad-ette is the most likely to be a female Gasshole."

It's not necessarily Faux Symbolism because often they don't even pretend to have intended some deep religious meaning behind it.\\nTo be fair, many ancient sources don't agree on the specific interpretations of individual myths and legends, and many ancient writers would interpret them to prove whatever point they were trying to make. For example, most contemporary portrayals of the sorceress Medea have the deaths of her children be an accident, or a case of mistaken interpretation where the children turn out all right at the end. It wasn't until Euripides' play that Medea was turned into the purposeful murderess of her own offspring (even if she had the tiniest bit of sympathetic motivation for doing so), making this Older Than Feudalism.\\nThis frequently happens to any god, no matter how benign, who happens to have any dominion over death or the underworld, due to Bad Powers, Bad People.\\nIn Western media, due to the Jesus Taboo and the like, pagan mythologies are more susceptible.

      "RaidersOfTheLostArk": "Raiders of the Lost Ark\\n The main weapon of the German soldiers is the MP 40, despite the movie taking place in 1936. The MP 40 was the MP 38 slightly redesigned to be cheaper to manufacture and a little safer to carry, and the two are visually nearly identical, but still falls 2 years too short. Of course, as the Germans were collecting paranormal technology, they obviously must have gotten a hold of a short duration time-machine.\\n Something more jarring: Near the finale, Indiana Jones threatens the bad guys by aiming at them with a rocket launcher. The goof is that the rocket launcher is not of German manufacture, but actually a 1950s model of the Soviet RPG series, the RPG-2. A smaller, but still present issue is that the film takes place in the mid 1930s, even though no militaries at the time had developed rocket launchers yet. They only came about in the 1940s, as a more powerful successor to the anti-tank rifles used up until then.\\n Another, smaller goof, is that Indy is at one point seen with an Inglis Hi-Power, a Canadian variation of Browning's design that didn't begin production until 1944. Even having the original FN Hi-Power, like he does in the bar shootout,note\\u00A0Indy was originally envisioned as having the Colt 1911 for at least this scene, but as above, since 9mm blanks were more reliable they went with the Hi-Power instead would have been a bit of a stretch, since it would have only been in production for a year at best at the time of the film. Moreover, the initial sales were almost all for military contracts and FN had an agreement with Colt at the time to not sell its guns in the United States. So Indy would've needed to meet up with an FN sales agent in Europe and special-order the pistol.",
      "general": "The practice of giving inappropriate firearms to characters or factions in a TV show or movie. They're generally inappropriate because they are either outdated, too modern for the setting, or because the group in question wouldn't have access to them (like Soviet soldiers wielding Uzis)\\nNeedless to say, it isn't restricted to guns, but they are always the first and most notable victim. Which is strange, as it's generally a lot easier to get a few MP-40's than to arrange for a Tiger tank to show up in your production.\\nOne reason this can happen (especially for things more expensive than guns) is that the \\\"right\\\" weapon may not be available, and an incorrect version easier to come by than it would be to make a replica. For example, Chinese AK clones commonly stand in for the real thing in American movies made during the Cold War. An extreme case would be armoured vehicles; there is only one WW2-vintage Tiger tank that still runs in the entire world and leasing a running mock-up from a private collection would be far more expensive than simply using some other tank and hoping the audience doesn't figure it out. This goes even more for ships; before modern CGI, movies were often forced to either use contemporary warships (even with a stratospheric budget, Pearl Harbor's Japanese carrier set was built on the deck of a modern carrier, made obvious by the visible steam catapult runs) or unconvincing models.\\nAnime and video games have no similar excuse, since they can by definition include anything the artists can draw or render, no matter how hard it might be to acquire a real example. One of the major reasons (aside from Rule of Cool and a desire to include the creator's favorite guns no matter how little sense it makes) is that the designers often are not \\\"gun people\\\" and just copy what they saw in movies.\\nWhile guns are a fairly mature technology with most new designs being more ergonomic than mechanically different (which seems to boil down to more plastic, short stroke gas piston (which actually seems to make weapons more difficult to handle on account of a jumpier recoil action occuring far forwards), and ripping off the AR-15 controls and lower receiver rather than any actual innovations), some shows will push this and it gets unrealistic when a gun is still in use in an entirely different universe, 1,000,000,000 years from now, or 100 years before it was designed.\\nSee also A.K.A.-47, Improbable Weapon Usage, Rare Guns, Selective Historical Armoury, Just Plane Wrong, Tanks, but No Tanks and Artistic License \\u2013 Ships."

It's implied that karmically this is the right thing to do, though, so that stroke of luck will happen nearly every time as a \\\"reward.\\\"\\nEven trained police and military will do this, which goes against every rule and all logic in real life in regards to this situation. In fact, there was an episode of Cops where we see the trainer emphatically tell the police officers to never take their gun off for a hostage taker.\\nA possible reason why this works in fiction is that Evil Is Cool in there. In Real Life, criminals are far more cowardly and most definitely not cool. On the other hand, hitting an object as small as a person's head at more than a few paces with a handgun is really difficult, so it's more of a case of psychological pressure on a cowardly criminal that makes this trope far from Truth in Television, but that could be said of most cases of defensive firearm use.\\nThe main problem with the situation is that the hostage taker, barring the occasional ones who are willing to give their life, doesn't want to shoot the hostage much more than the heroes do. If they were to kill the hostage because the heroes refused to drop the guns, there is suddenly nothing to keep the heroes from using said guns. However, the characters almost never think this through.\\nThis is usually not Truth in Television: real-life police and military forces train their people to never put down their guns in a hostage situation, because if you do you'll just end up with a dead hostage and a dead hero.\\nThis trope is often subverted to show either that a character is edgy and a possible Anti-Hero, or that they're Just That Good.\\nCompare Hostage for MacGuffin."

Heck, what happens when it's not even enough to just shoot someone dead? Why, you do something that will inflict the pain of having one's skin torn off by fast-moving asphalt while being flung around chaotically, occasionally being thrown, at high speed, into stationary and possibly immovable objects!\\nWhen a character is mangled or killed by being tied or attached to something fast moving, like a car, this trope comes into play. The victim is dragged along the ground like a bag of screaming meat. This is a form of Cruel and Unusual Death and Cold-Blooded Torture, to say the least.\\nOf course, there are versions of this trope that aren't portrayed as quite so extreme.

      "general": "Blood is a primal fear, which makes it, and other things you'd usually like to keep in your body, ripe for scaring people with in fiction. If someone is bleeding out you know they've been attacked or are in danger of dying, and when there's blood puddling in an everyday place you know that place is no longer safe and should fear for a character's life. This is a staple of the Horror Genre. Appearing in hauntings and Survival Horrors such as Zombie Apocalypse stories. It's also used in Murder Mysteries, and Serial Killer stories that have elements of horror.\\nThis trope is the reason why Blood-Splattered Innocents, Blood Is the New Black and Blood-Splattered Wedding Dress are horrifying, and that fear is why Evil Is Visceral. Blood from the Mouth is often combined with Incurable Cough of Death to induce horror and signal to the viewer they should fear for a person's life.\\nThere are many ways blood can invoke fear. Haunting stories sometimes have blood supernaturally \\\"bleeding\\\" and dripping down/out from furniture, and architecture, for unnaturalness and creepiness. Blood can also signify danger is nearby, and that somebody was wounded or worse killed. Murder Mysteries with horror elements have gorey murders specifically for this reason, some going beyond just blood, and showing the victim's internal organs or separated body parts. Finally blood and gore is very often used as Gross Out Horror, which also makes it pretty common in Medical Dramas, to show the character's health is declining or it's shown during surgery. Either way it signals the audience should fear for the patient's life.\\nThere's no question, psychologically why this is the case. The fears of blood and death are very common, and most people like to keep their blood inside their body, and the rest of their body intact. This trope is why kid's show's tend to use symbolism in place of bleeding, use non standard colors for blood or just have Bloodless Carnage to get around the censors. This is because blood horror is often seen as too scary for young children.\\nSince this has a lot of overlap with Death Tropes, and thus is ripe with spoilers spoilers will be unmarked.\\nHorror and Body Horror are Super Tropes to this. Related to Overdrawn at the Blood Bank, High-Pressure Blood, Evil Is Visceral, and Afraid of Blood which is about specific characters that freak out at even minor sights of blood like paper cuts and donor blood packs. Some Subtropes are Blood-Splattered Innocents, Blood-Splattered Wedding Dress, Blood Is the New Black, and Couldn't Find a Pen. Chest Burster is a variation. Compare Paint the Town Red and Symbolic Blood. Also see Blood Magic for when blood is used for magic by ritualistic sacrifice. Contrast Bloody Hilarious, where blood is played for Black Comedy, and Bloodless Carnage where scenes where characters would normally bleed are censored to be less scary. Not to be confused with Gorn which isn't intended to make people afraid, but uses gore to \\\"thrill\\\" the audience instead.\\nSee Did Not Do the Bloody Research for \\\"bloody\\\" as a curse word.

      "general": "A shot in which only a part of the shot, usually the area immediately surrounding any of the characters present on-screen, is a live action shot. The rest is a painting, most often used to portray a non-existent vista. Rather than build a vast set, they shoot the actors on a plain set with a few background elements, with parts of the camera frame matted off by opaque cards. Later, an opposite set of cards, matting the parts of the frame that were already exposed, is used to shoot the background; in most cases this is a detailed, realistic \\\"matte painting\\\" done in acrylics on glass by a dedicated artist, but it could also be miniatures or location footage. Low-budget films, and films where whatever was in front of the matte was hoped to be distracting, sometimes used paintings on canvas.\\nWith the advent of high-definition television, matte paintings can fall into Conspicuous CG territory: peer closely at any long shot that lasts more than a few seconds where the main action is going on in the foreground, and the background will very likely be a matte painting.\\nIn the electronic editing era, the matte shot is often used to refer to a Chroma Key shot, which uses a similar principle. This system has replaced any number of early film tricks. Classic Matte Shots had one advantage over Chroma Key, though: you could matte anything of any color equally well (or badly)."

      "general": "Smoking is generally considered bad for you. Thus, smoking is portrayed by the villain, so as to drive home the Aesop that Drugs Are Bad.\\nIt is almost never portrayed as 'cool' in 21st century media, and even the Badass seems to be quitting the habit. In children's cartoons, it's perfectly acceptable for a villain to smoke, especially if they blow it in somebody's face, but the hero thinks it's a disgusting habit, or they may be trying to quit. Alternatively, a heavy smoker may be shown as extremely affected by the smoke to show how bad it is.\\nThe rule is suspended under very specific conditions:\\n The smoker is someone wise or fatherly. This uses pipes.\\n The smoker is sexy.\\n The smoker is under extreme amounts of stress (usually associated with nervous pacing; think \\\"father in a maternity ward\\\").\\n The smoker is incredibly Badass. This often uses a Cigar Chomper.\\n The smoker is celebrating; cigars are associated with 'special occasions' because they are expensive.\\n The smoking is correct to the era. This is why World War I movies have soldiers smoking: in that era, everyone smoked in the trenches to drown out the terrible smell.\\n The smoker is French, and somebody wants to be stereotypical.\\n The smoker is Native American, and only smokes a Peace Pipe as a cultural gesture.\\n The smoker isn't really smoking, but rather blowing bubbles from a Bubble Pipe or something like that.\\n The smoker is rich, and has enough money to blow on large amounts of cigarettes, cigars etc.\\n The smoker is a vampire (or something similar) and thus is already dead anyway.\\nAlso, what and how one smokes determines Good Smoking from Evil Smoking.\\n A cigarette holder, especially the long ones, is an Evil Smoking indicator, usually reserved for evil bitches of all kinds. However, as symbols of class and elegance, a female using a cigarette holder could be either Good or Evil, depending on the time the work was made.\\n Male users of cigarette holders are always Evil unless they're The Pink Panther, Hunter S. Thompson, or FDR (or an Expy thereof), who is allowed to use the holder by means of the Grandfather Clause.note\\u00A0 (FDR himself once explained to a child that he used a cigarette holder because \\\"I promised my doctor that I would stay as far away as possible from a cigarette.\\\")\\n Long and fine cigarettes often indicate a bitch or a Depraved Homosexual.\\n A character smoking several cigarettes at once indicates a rebellious character who has little to no disregard for their health.\\n A pipe is a Good Smoking indicator, usually reserved for grandfatherly gentlemen. If the character is younger, he is calm, collected and stoic, probably an intellectual, and probably a character in a period piece. A member of law enforcement, most often a detective (or Private Eye), is more likely to use a pipe in homage to a certain famous pipe-smoking detective. If they do, this also generally makes them a Good Smoker and not a Dirty Cop. If a woman smokes a pipe, she is inevitably old enough to be a grandmother, working class or dirt-poor and from a rural area.\\n The exception is East Asian women, if they're not Westernized enough to smoke cigarettes; while not being Westernized obviously often goes along with poverty and/or isolation, there is also a certain tendency in Asia for the wealthy, especially wealthy women, to stick to traditional dress and habits. Western customs were partly adopted as a business expedient, after all, and the alternative therefore has gained connotations of luxury and leisure.\\n Clove cigarettes are cool smoking. Alternately, they may be the sign of a pretentious hipster douchebag. Kind of like the Emo Kid version of Beard of Evil.\\n The character is The Stoner, and smoking is a part of their character. Of course in a lot of films with Stoners, The Stoner gets killed so smoking is very, very bad for you indeed...\\n Smoking weed goes all over the place with this trope, mostly because works have differing opinions if Drugs Are Bad and if the people who use them are bad also.\\n In stoner friendly productions, a good smoker is someone that sticks to mostly soft natural psychoactives (Marijuana, Salvia, mushrooms, etc) and the occasional LSD, but this only applies when contrasted with someone that does hard drugs like Meth, crack or Angel Dust.\\n Characters who smoke lots of Cigars are some combination of Badass, Jerkass and rich. Generally, the Corrupt Corporate Executive and Rebel will smoke cigars. If the smoker is out of shape and well-dressed, then they're evil or at least a self-important jerk (unless they're Winston Churchill). If the smoker is muscle-bound and wearing rough clothing, they're generally either morally gray or heroic badasses. A woman who smokes a cigar is usually The Vamp.\\n  It isn't entirely clear-cut, but good characters will often smoke slender cigars, and evil characters fat ones. Since Cuba is under a trade embargo from the US, anyone in American media who smokes Cuban cigars is guaranteed to be some stripe of sleazebag.\\n Cigarillos are usually sleazy, low-level evil with a tendency to droop. Of course, there is Clint Eastwood.\\n Also an indicator of Evil Smoking is if they hold a cigarette in an unusual way. As Jim Jarmusch comments to Harvey Keitel in Blue In The Face:\\nNot surprisingly, before the Surgeon General's report on tobacco use this trope was almost completely reversed. Non-Smokers were uptight and uncool, Smokers were just doing what everybody else did, and were perfectly normal, and made smoking look cool and perfectly healthy. It was more common for heroes to smoke than villains.\\nSubtrope of Good Flaws, Bad Flaws\\nSee Also: Red Right Hand, Uncleanliness Is Next to Ungodliness, Fur and Loathing.\\nContrast Smoking Is Cool, Everybody Smokes, and No Smoking."

      "general": "Marches are Exactly What It Says on the Tin: Music that is written to accompany marches. While marches were originally written to provide cadence for marching soldiers, Marches have also been written for parades, funerals, processions, graduation ceremonies, political rallies, circuses, opera... just about anything that requires a steady rhythm between 60 and 120 beats per minute, though concert marches can be significantly faster and circus marches, also known as \\\"Screamers\\\", can really rip. Marches were considered the world's popular music at the turn of the 20th century and the bread and butter of famous composers like Kenneth Alford, Edwin Eugene Bagley, Julius Fucik, Roland F. Seitz and \\\"The March King\\\" himself, John Philip Sousa.\\nThe standard march form tends to be written in duple meter, with an introduction, two strains, a triple and a stinger...but here at TV Tropes we don't particularly care about that. If you want to know about that stuff, or the usages of theme and counterpoint, consult Wikipedia. No, our concern is with the use of march music to set theme and tone in other media, for nothing says that things have gotten serious, as in military-grade industrial mobilization serious, as a march tempo. The Empire will almost always have a march as their leitmotif, and the hero will too if he needs an especially rousing theme tune. And there was a period during the late 1950s where marches were very popular as movie and TV themes. Some marches have become so ingrained in our popular consciousness that one cannot hear them without envisioning the scenes that they evoke, inspiring creators to include them (or a ciose knock off) in order to set the scene.\\nWhile it's impossible to select one march as the most iconic ever written, for most people in the English speaking world the term \\\"March\\\" usually calls to mind three pieces: Alford's Colonel Bogey, Sousa's Stars and Stripes Forever, and Edwin Eugene Bagley's National Emblem. Interestingly, Sousa himself listed National Emblem as one of the three most effective street marches ever written."

      "general": "Want to show that your Evil Overlord, or someone within The Empire is a genuine bad guy, regardless of their rank in The Empire or how minor a character they are? Simple, all you have to do is have them Kick the Dog, right? Well, what if there isn't a handy dog around? Have them kick whatever minority race/species or gender/sexuality or lower class scum is around instead to show that they're a really bad guy. Bonus points if either the heroes or some highly sympathetic character is a member of said minority.\\nDepending on how and with whom this is used, it can sometimes come across as just slightly odd. It generally works best with minor characters who have not had a lot of time in the attention of the audience, since you can easily reveal that their Hidden Depths are really rather unpleasant, thus allowing you to cement them as unlikeable or have the character graduate from being an annoying obstacle to someone the fans will cheer to see put down.\\nIt doesn't always work as well with the Magnificent Bastard Evil Overlord types, particularly if introduced late into their run as an antagonist. Because honestly, if the fandom hasn't turned against the Overlord after the character in question may have murdered thousands or even millions, enslaved people in The Empire wholesale, and so on and so forth, is having the character be a little sexist or racist really going to automatically turn people against them? (In particularly bad cases of Misaimed Fandom where the fans were already using every scrap of evidence and threadbare argument to argue that the bad guys weren't that bad, you may risk the character's fans declaring this to be a Fanon Discontinuity, and possibly even splitting the fanbase). In these cases, to make it work, you might have to do a purposeful Flanderization to your character and make them all about their bias. Of course, that will also mean you've gone and derailed your own plot if you need to do it to that extent...\\nA notable key to this is that the racism, sexism, Fantastic Racism, or whatever displayed by the character is often completely gratuitous or extraneous to the rest of their villainy. Usually, whatever their goal might be, they don't have to be a racist, speciesist, or sexist to accomplish it - but they are.\\nThis is the reason why Those Wacky Nazis and The Klan are at the bottom of the villain food chain, and it's a good bet that the Politically Incorrect Villain will be the one going down in an Even Evil Has Standards team-up.\\nAlso, people might sometimes see this trope where it doesn't exist. Some villains are simply bullying types who go after minorities without really caring whether people will find it politically incorrect or not - and it doesn't have to matter if their targets remind them of themselves in some way. Why do they do this? Genre savviness, primarily; after all, minorities lack the numbers to fight back, and there's nothing to be gained from Bullying a Dragon.\\nCompare Evil Is Petty and He-Man Woman Hater; Contrast Equal-Opportunity Evil. Note however that they are not mutually exclusive; a villain can be progressive towards some groups but intolerant towards others. Compare and contrast the Politically Incorrect Hero. May lead to Felony Misdemeanor if this character type is thought to be more evil than outwardly flamboyant villains. Any and all instances of Those Wacky Nazis qualify automatically, and A Nazi by Any Other Name often does.\\nThis is not when a villain is a minority who is portrayed in a politically incorrect manner. That's Unfortunate Implications, assuming it's unintentional. This should also not be confused with Values Dissonance, where the author apparently has these attitudes."

Their purpose is almost exclusively to give the writers someone to kill who isn't a main character, although they can also serve as a Spear Carrier. In a series where The Main Characters Do Everything, if you suddenly see someone else who you've never seen before involved in the main story, they are probably a Redshirt.\\nThey are used to show how the monster works, and demonstrate that it is indeed a deadly menace, without having to lose anyone important. Expect someone to say \\\"He's Dead, Jim\\\", lament this \\\"valued crew member's senseless death\\\", and then promptly forget him. Security personnel in general fall victim to the worst shade of this trope, as most of the time their deaths aren't even acknowledged at all; according to Hollywood, you could walk into a bank and shoot a security guard right in the face without anyone making a fuss. If you shot anyone else afterward, the headline would just read \\\"Bank Customers Killed\\\".\\nIn mass quantities, they make up the Red Shirt Army. Frequently overlaps with Men Are the Expendable Gender and Black Dude Dies First.\\nWhile Star Trek has the dubious honor of being the Trope Namer, the Trope is actually very inaccurate if you compare the franchise to Real Life. If you were to watch every episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, count the number of casualties that the Enterprise had (including those who didn't wear red, which as stated below, happened much more often than many might believe), and then compare that to an actual military unit, you'd see that Kirk's record as a leader in this regard is excellent, far better than any general in U.S. history. (And he is almost always enraged when it happens.) Even war heroes like George Washington and Dwight D. Eisenhower had proportionately more casualties among their troops. But apparently in the \\\"Star Trek T.O.S.,\\\" there were more in gold than red who were killed off.

Sometimes intentional, but often the result of Expospeak cut for time.

Fine, then you may get the second most popular ninja weapon: Nunchaku.\\nNunchucks, like the katana, are the Japanese weaponization of the Rule of Cool. All ninjas that don't use swords use chucks and anyone that knows karate knows how to use them. They are even so easy to make that you can just chain two things together and make Instant Chucks. Unfortunately, nunchucks are to katana as Luigi is to Mario, badass on its own but is never given the lime light.\\nThe nunchaku are a popular martial arts weapon developed from the rice flail in China, Okinawa, and possibly other places in the Far East, consisting of two hard sticks of wood or metal joined together by a cord or chain. In addition to being used for powerful strikes, the cord can also be used for strangling enemies. A three-stick variant of this weapon exists called the three-sectional staff (sansetsukon in Japan and san jie gun in China), which is primarily used in Chinese kung fu.\\nOften wielded by the Bruce Lee Clone. As such, in comedic series, expect anyone wielding nunchuks to make lots of Funny Bruce Lee Noises, just before their inevitable failure.\\nIt should also be noted that ninja never actually used nunchucks. Since they were spies more than warriors, when they had to fight someone, they normally had to kill their opponent quickly and effectively, and nunchuks were definitely not up for that kind of job. It was more a weapon used by farmers and peasants to defend themselves from attackers, since they were easy to make, they could be mistaken by farmers' tools at first glance, and don't require such a high level of skill to use effectively. Or at least to use without hurting oneself permanently.\\nFor a greater variety of flail weapons, see Epic Flail.\\nThis trope is not about fighting with a pair of shoes, by the way (although you certainly could make some nunchuks with some Chucks...). Nor is it about fighting with a certain Nintendo peripheral called a Nunchuck. Although those things do hurt if you let go by accident while it's hooked to the remote...\\nThis trope is also not about multiple Chuck Norrises, because the universe is only big enough for one Chuck Norris, and he's more than a match for anyone on the planet."

At times, a goodie and a baddie just have to have a one-on-one fight, with Swords.\\nIn any given story, the main character is fairly likely to be somewhat proficient with a sword. In video games, anime, and certain sci-fi-fantasy stories, indeed, large segments of the population prefer swords as their primary weapons, over any firearms that may be available. This is true even in many cases where it would be far more intelligent to use a firearm.\\nBonus points when it's a modern setting, and using a blade is Awesome but Impractical because you Never Bring a Knife to a Gun Fight and the hero is far less likely to possess the training needed to use a sword. Exactly why this is the case varies. In some settings, swords offer advantages that guns do not. Perhaps the predominant point-defensive system is effective against ranged weaponry and not against blades, \\u00E0 la Dune. Sometimes the enemy and duelists are invulnerable to ranged weapons, such as through using the Force or Implausible Fencing Powers to deflect bullets, which means that they must battle in close-range with formalized sword martial arts that counteract this invulnerability. Perhaps it is a formalized duel where modern weapons are forbidden. Or perhaps the people using swords or edged weapons are just that cool, \\u00E0 la the Jedi. Sometimes, of course, it is left unexplained.\\nA similar trope results when two characters choose to battle each other with their bare hands, for absolutely no reason at all. Even if one of them (usually the hero) has a gun, he will throw it away, preferring the visceral satisfaction (and added chance of failure) of beating his rival's face in. Again, this has no practical value in nearly all cases.\\nUnfortunately, even when use of swords is justified, it is usually done unrealistically. Rule of Cool fight-choreography, and safety guidelines that minimize hazard to actors have led to a wide acceptance of the unrealistic image of swordplay.\\nCommon sub-tropes:\\n\\n Audible Sharpness\\n Barehanded Blade Block\\n Blade Lock\\n Cutlass Between the Teeth\\n Flynning\\n Implausible Fencing Powers\\n Reverse Grip\\n Slice-and-Dice Swordsmanship\\n Sword Drag\\n Sword Limbo\\n Sword Lines\\n Sword over Head\\n Sword Sparks\\n Throwing Your Sword Always Works\\n Twinkle Toes Samurai\\n Weapon Stomp\\n You Fight Like a Cow"

      "general": "It is a pretty good bet that just about any show that features adults and teens interacting in an academic environment will eventually explore a romantic relationship between a teacher and a student. The basis for this type of relationship \\u2014 if it's actually a romance and not just a Sextra Credit arrangement \\u2014 can either be the adoration and respect toward the teacher/mentor figure or the teacher's protective and caring instincts, or both. The illicit, forbidden and most often scandalous nature of these relationships can be mined for angst, and generally doesn't cause real life issues because the actors themselves are generally all above the age of consent thanks to Dawson Casting. But even if the student is eighteen or in college, this sort of extracurricular activity would still be a massive breach of professional ethics in most of the world and in some jurisdictions is considered illegal, regardless of age, in some circumstances (some teachers have been charged for relationships with high school students, even if the relationship didn't begin until after the student turned 18 and the teacher her/himself was only a few years older). Even if it was not illegal, the scandal that would erupt from this socially unacceptable affair would be so devastating it would basically cost a teacher or professor his or her job forever.\\nThere are usually different levels of moral endorsement of the relationship, depending on the genders of the participants. Relationships between male teachers and male students are condemned the most harshly, and more outrage tends to occur when a male teacher and a female student are together than when it's the other way around. An even more outrageous double standard is that emphasis is often placed on how attractive said female teacher is \\u2014 the more attractive said teacher, the more acceptable the relationship is. Unless of course we're talking about a lesbian teacher, in which case the outrage comes right back on.\\nAn author might attempt to make this relationship less squicky by having the student fulfill the Wise Beyond Their Years trope or by keeping things to Courtly Love only.\\nThe relationship may be initiated by a Fille Fatale. A subtrope of Unequal Pairing. Compare Mrs. Robinson. See Likes Older Women and Stacy's Mom for young people lusting after older people in general, Precocious Crush for a more innocent variant, and Mentor Ship. There's a version specific to magic users called Merlin and Nimue, which takes its cue from the Arthurian Mythos where Merlin formed such a pair with several women.\\nThis group of tropes is among The Oldest Ones in the Book.

Pretty soon the villain is already down on one knee and The Hero is ready to use their finishing strike. The Hero prepares the attack and it looks like victory is ensured.\\nBut wait, what's this? Instead of performing their signature finishing blow, The Hero has doubled-over in pain, clutching their side! What gives?\\nUnfortunately, it looks like The Hero is suffering from a Game-Breaking Injury.\\nA Game-Breaking Injury like this develops from damage a character had taken on in an earlier encounter, whether it be from an everyday accident or received while fighting off a few Elite Mooks. The opponent will probably notice the character's weakened state and use this opportunity to turn the tide of battle. If they really want to ensure victory, then the opponent will take every chance to aggravate the injury even more by relentlessly attacking it.\\nUnlike the Achilles' Heel, a Game-Breaking Injury is not an intrinsic weakness as it is acquired by accident or through the opponent's doing. Sometimes the enemy in question can recognize the difference in physical ability between themselves and The Hero and will first cripple them before using their normal battle strategies. Game-Breaking Injuries do not signify the impending victory or defeat of a character; however, their presence can significantly alter the fight's outcome.\\nGame-Breaking Injuries can be used either as a plot device or as a means of character development. With enough Heroic Resolve, The Hero might be able to push through the pain and continue fighting. If a member of The Team is involved in this trope and he or she is of greater skill than The Big Bad, they might suffer a Game-Breaking Injury to level the playing field.

      "RaidersOfTheLostArk": "The Nazi flying wing from Raiders of the Lost Ark never existed in real life. The Nazis did finally come up with a working flying wing towards the end of the war (eight years after the film takes place), but it had a different design than the one seen in Raiders so apparently it's an outright fictional aircraft instead of just an anachronism.",
      "general": "With few exceptions, pretty much everyone agrees that the Nazis were very, very bad, what with the socio-political repression, the institutionalized racist policies, the wars of aggression against their neighbours, the mass imprisonment and murder of dissidents and undesirables, the attempt to exterminate the entire population of eastern Europe and replace them with Germans, and forever ruining the reputations of eugenics and social darwinism as serious academic disciplines. So, how do you make Those Wacky Nazis even more intimidating? Why, by giving them Powered Armor and alien allies, of course!\\nWhile no such thing would actually happen without serious alterations to the personalities of Hitler and most of the German high command note\\u00A0their Air Ministry, the RLM, in particular had roughly the same attitude towards research projects that a magpie would have in a tinfoil factory, there is some historical precedent. Nazi Germany was the first to create practical versions of numerous weapons and progressed enough in rocketry to injure or kill almost 100,000 British people with a few thousand rockets, and courtesy of the USA's Operation Paperclip earned nearly two thousand German scientists (such as Wernher Von Braun) free passports to the US once the war was over along with immunity from prosecution for extensively using slave labour and working thousands of them to death. Many late-war experimental weapons were touted as Wunderwaffen, (lit. 'wonder weapons') that would enable the besieged Germans to turn the tide of the war and defeat the Allies or at least negotiate for peace. Given the fact that Nazis from the frontline troops all the way to the top of the command chain were taking drugs it's no real surprise that some of the approved weapon ideas were...unconventional.\\nDespite this reputation for producing very sophisticated weapons and equipment, the reality was that most Nazi super-weapons were incredibly expensive and in the vast majority of cases totally impractical. Moreover, many of them were also less refined and efficient ('advanced') than the experimental devices being tested in the outside world. For example, jetpack technology itself wasn't rendered workable until 1958 and without an alternative fuel source, still remains impractical today. Many of the super-heavy tank designs Germany came up with in the later years of the war were extremely large and slow, too expensive to build and operate in numbers, and could still be destroyed or disabled by conventional weaponry. Infantry weapons like the FG-42 or STG-44 made use of concepts that were ahead of their time, but their actual performance was spotty due to unreliable manufacturing circumstances and numerous flaws in the actual details of the designs, negating any advantages they had in the first place. Arthur C. Clarke's short story, Superiority, succinctly summarizes many of the problems with the Nazis' approach to the R&D of weapons and equipment.\\nIronically, Germany's focus on \\\"wonder weapons\\\" late in the war stemmed from its precarious strategic position, which was so dire (and self-inflicted) that only the notion of some crazy, weird, yet actually successful miracle of a weapon was seen as a viable hope for Nazi Germany's continued existence. And since the actual resources, industry, manpower, and time needed to actually produce any such wonder weapons in significant numbers was insufficient long before the writing was clearly on the wall (and getting ever worse), the diversion of precious resources and industry to these projects just hastened their defeat. In a further twist of irony, many scientists who were driven out of Europe by the Third Reich's discriminatory policies went to work on the Manhattan Project, which produced what is arguably the only true wonder weapon of the war.\\nNonetheless, if you have to pick one WWII power to give antigravity and a moonbase, the choice is obvious; after all, it's boring if the good guys have all the toys. Not to mention that Einstein (though a pacifist and a Jew, so hardly on Hitler's Christmas card list) was German (and there are a lot of rumours that the reason why America wanted nuclear power fast is that they thought Nazi Germany would develop it first), and Tesla, although actually Serbo-Croatian (a Slav, so a member of another of Hitler's exterminate-on-sight groups), is frequently confused with this due to the country being part of the Austrian Empire when he was born. Needless to say, the theme is played upon endlessly in pulp callbacks, B-movies, and modern occult works.\\nContrast Nazis with Gnarly Weapons, which is about the weapons they had in Real Life. See also Ghostapo, where Nazis uses super-demonry rather than (or combined with) super-science; and Soviet Superscience, when it's the Dirty Commies showing up with giant robots and spaceships. Compare Historical Villain Upgrade. Subtrope of Weird Historical War.\\nPlease do not confuse with Stupid Sexy Flanders. (Oops.)"

      "RaidersOfTheLostArk": "Inverted with Raiders of the Lost Ark, as the filmmakers had to add a wall of fire to slightly obscure Belloq in the scene where his head explodes. Otherwise, the film would've gotten an R rating.",
      "general": "Movies may be art and to tell stories, but as far as the funders and distributors are concerned, films need to make money and get the biggest possible audience. Achieving this may involve lying about a movie's content, showing all the best parts, or, with family movies, changing the rating.\\nPerception means a lot \\u2013 R ratings tend to indicate something for adults (but not always). G ratings often indicate something for kids. In between are PG and PG-13 movies. So with a lot of otherwise perfectly clean, family-friendly movies, the word \\\"damn\\\" or \\\"hell\\\" (or both) might be added to the script, just to drop that dreaded G rating. The phrase \\\"brief mild language\\\" appearing as a content warning is a giveaway. At PG, the movie has a better shot at avoiding the \\\"kid stuff\\\" stigma that keeps teen or adult viewers away.\\nAdding a little swearing makes the film easy to edit for TV or airplane viewings without it interrupting the story. Sometimes stronger profanity is unnecessarily added, or the characters pay an irrelevant and fleeting visit to a strip club, or scenes are made more violent. Content is sometimes added to get an intentional PG-13 rating, or removed from a potential R-rated movie for the same reason. It's all about trying to get a certain audience to watch the film;\\nIronically, the average G-rated film makes more money than the average R-rated film, but maybe only because G-ratings are rarer. In the UK, the practice is sometimes known as \\\"fifteening\\\" since the target was the BBFC 15 rating, though this faded with the advent of the 12 and 12A ratings.\\nToday in the U.S., it's nearly impossible to get a G rating on any live-action movie without some serious negotiation. It apparently is to reinforce the Animation Age Ghetto; the MPAA is more than happy to rate something as PG for \\\"nothing offensive\\\" because it's live action. Almost no live-action movies make it to theaters with a G rating anymore.\\nIt wasn't always this way. Since 1968, when modern MPAA ratings began, the G rating has shifted and been significantly Flanderized. Originally, \\\"G\\\" ratings were for movies for a \\\"General\\\" audience, not for \\\"Grandmas & Goo-goo-babies.\\\" The earliest G-rated films not only included violence, but sometimes even showed blood. Planet of the Apes (1968), released the same year the MPAA ratings started, was rated G, but you saw Charlton Heston's bare butt and violence, and heard \\\"damn dirty ape\\\" and \\\"God damn you all to hell!\\\" As late as 1979, Star Trek The Motion Picture was rated G despite a couple of horrific deaths by Teleporter Accident.note\\u00A0The G-rated Gone with the Wind (which was made during The Hays Code era, long before the modern ratings system, but received a G rating upon rerelease in 1971) has the most famous use of the word \\\"damn\\\" in history. It also contains a lot of other distinctly non-G-rated things \\u2014 barely-off-screen sex, open bloodshed, and a sea of dead bodies.\\nThe change happened in the early 1980's, about after complaints from Moral Guardians about movies like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Gremlins and Poltergeist, all of which received PG ratings, and thus were seen by many young children who really shouldn't have. After this, the MPAA introduced the PG-13 rating, so movies that would've been PG under the old standard became PG-13, with the more \\\"mature\\\" G movies now becoming PG. Thus, the demographic for films that remained G became very young.note\\u00A0This happened shortly before VCR's took off. It turned out that the sort of film that could get a G rating after that is the sort that is usually more profitable direct to video.\\nLater attempts to content-rate other media in the United States used the by-now-obvious shortcomings of the MPAA system as an object lesson. When US television created its ratings in the late 90's, the \\\"G is for Grandma\\\" effect was mentioned specifically, and is almost certainly the motivation for the US TV rating system having both a TV-Y rating and a TV-G rating: TV-Y is \\\"specifically for kids\\\", and TV-G means \\\"nothing offensive\\\". Similarly, the ESRB ratings for video games, needing to account for both content and playability, have both the \\\"E for Everyone\\\" rating and others for younger age groups (some lower-end E10+ games suffer as well, albeit to a lesser extent). Even though the video game industry is no stranger to edginess for marketing's sake, this trope is probably least common in video games. That said, \\\"E for Everyone\\\" changed from its original name, \\\"K-A for Kids to Adults\\\", specifically because games sold better among older gamers when the rating didn't have \\\"kid\\\" in it.\\nSee Rated M for Money, and for more information on the rating systems see Media Classifications.\\nThis is NOT about movies that just happen to have a high rating. It is only about when something clearly unnecessary and unneeded is added to bump the rating higher, because without it the rating would be lower than what the company wants. Also note that it's not always certain what caused a movie to get (or not get) a certain rating, as outside of a few guidelines, the MPAA ratings are a black box."

Alternatively, he can jump onto the hood and glare at the driver while said driver tries to shake him off. Larger vehicles can also be used (particularly popular version is jumping onto a tall vehicle from an overhead bridge) - if it's a truck, for example, our Hero will often need to climb forward to the cab somehow. (You can also climb about on trains, but they're a bit different, since they don't swerve about.)\\nBusted by the MythBusters, who found it much less safe in reality than on the screen.\\nFor example, in Real Life, it is incredibly difficult to hold onto a car even at low speeds, and at high speeds, it is impossible to do so. It may be slightly easier to hold onto a train, but all of your effort has to be spent in just holding on and you have to be on top of a car that isn't rounded or containing hot liquids - plus, tunnels can cut too close to the roof for a standing person to survive passing through one. Aircraft - at least when we're talking jets, spacecraft, or anything that is flying at a sufficiently high speed and altitude - are literally impossible to stand on the outside of and doing so is certain death.\\nTwo variant forms have become outdated with modern car designs, but may be seen in older media. For a stealth Outside Ride, jump onto the back bumper and hold on tight (the technical term is Skitching). This is often a convenient way for the hero to get to the villain's hideout. A more obvious method would be to stand on the running board, though if the driver's not paying attention you might be able to crouch underneath the window before he sees you.\\nSee also: Hood Hopping, Traintop Battle, Underside Ride.

      "RaidersOfTheLostArk": "Raiders of the Lost Ark has a kookaburra in the South American Jungle",
      "general": "In fiction, animals are pretty loud. Dogs bark, birds chirp, snakes hiss, and so on; exactly where, when, and how you'd expect...\\nThe thing is, an animal in that situation in real life would probably be quiet.\\nCats tend to be quiet unless they want something and the same goes for horses and dogs, though they will whinny and bark if they are excited by something. Rats and mice rarely make human-audible noises. Owls only hoot to announce they've claimed such and such a spot and the same generally goes for every bird's song, every canine's howl, and so on. An animal who has been hurt in all likelihood will not react vocally at all, except for maybe one brief yelp at the moment of injury \\u2014 it's too dangerous to announce your incapacitation by sitting there crying for aid. And all the fictional predators who let out a blood-curdling roar/scream/whatever as they stalk their prey are idiots, because the whole point of a roar is to let you know that something big and dangerous is nearby and you'd better run.\\nThis trope can also cover animals whose \\\"characteristic\\\" calls and cries do not actually belong to them. All owls hoot, all big cats roar, and all birds of prey scream like the Red-Tailed Hawk (because a Bald Eagle's cry MUST be awesome.) More movies and TV shows than you can shake a stick at have ambient noise that includes bird calls of species not native to that region. This is especially common in movies filmed in California but set on some other continent, but even a movie filmed \\\"on location\\\" can have misplaced bird calls added in the editing process. Special mention must go to the frog. Only one type of frog goes \\\"ribbit\\\". It lives in Hollywood. Go figure.\\nA particularly jarring subtrope of the above is the tendency, in fiction, for everything to roar. Say your hero is being attacked by something non-human and possibly even outside the animal kingdom; a plant or a robot or something. But we still know it's angry and very dangerous. Why? Because the thing is roaring as it fights. It might also scream in pain if the hero manages to fight back. Man Eating Plants, despite lacking in the vocal cord--or lung--department, will roar, scream and hiss just in case you didn't know they were dangerous. In a similarly helpful manner Giant Spiders and Big Creepy-Crawlies scream or hiss and there are at least two documented cases (in fiction, of course) of roaring sharks. And if you've got to fight a robot that looks like a particular animal, you can be damn well certain that robot will make the sounds of that animal.\\nThe possibility that an enemy who attacks you in utter silence without saying a thing, or who instead makes utterly inorganic noises like grinding gears, might actually be far, far more chilling never, ever comes up.\\nThe trope title comes from any and all cases of ambient \\\"jungle sounds\\\" dubbed over scenes set out in the Wild. The funny thing about this is that one of the appealing things about visiting wild places is how quiet they tend to be, especially during the daytime. The forest only tends to be interesting, sound-wise, at night (and even then, it's relatively speaking) or during a short period in spring when all the songbirds are staking out their nesting spots. Visit in winter and you'll usually \\\"hear\\\" eerie silence.\\nMay disrupt Suspension of Disbelief for tropers who know their stuff about animals. Not to be confused with Cute but Cacophonic. Noisy forests also tend to be places where Everything is Trying To Kill You. See also Misplaced Wildlife, All Animals Are Dogs, and Bug Buzz. Use of Stock Sound Effects is a common culprit. Possibly related to Small Reference Pools.\\nThen again, possibly the best reason to use this trope is for our heroes to suddenly realize that it has suddenly gotten quiet.\\n\\nExamples"

Cue the bullwhip...\\n Justified in that the revolver is single-action and has to be cocked each time it's fired.",
      "general": "CHK-CHK\\nThe dramatic gun cock is employed when a character is up to some interrogation work while holding a gun to someone's head. The subject of the investigation is invited to divulge some critical information. The subject refuses or spouts an insult.\\nHere comes the dramatic gun cock. The interrogator pulls back the hammer of the revolver or automatic, or racks the slide if the automatic has no hammer, then resumes pointing the gun to the subject's head. Usually, this is enough to thoroughly spook the subject into full disclosure. A pump-action shotgun may also be used for this purpose, often with a One-Handed Shotgun Pump, albeit it's overall not as popular as doing it with guns. Filmmakers who are aiming for dramatic effect over realism may even employ the dramatic gun cock with a gun that doesn't actually fire a projectile.\\nIn other situations, the dramatic gun cock serves to announce a character's presence, or (especially when taking place off-camera) to indicate that the tables have turned in some way. This is a *Click* Hello, and often occurs in conjunction with a My Name Is Inigo Montoya moment.\\nThe sound effect is often added in by sound editors after filming. This can be especially noticeable when the character onscreen is using a gun that cannot be manually cocked. Examples include the Luger and the Glock.\\nIf it seems odd that this happens so often in the movies, it helps to tell yourself the characters are actually members of a religion who believe repeatedly cocking your gun at someone will give them cancer.\\nThe dramatic gun cock may be accompanied by a Pistol-Whipping. Subtrope of Kinetic Clicking. Can sometimes lead to Guns Do Not Work That Way when a (semi)automatic gun that has already been shown to be actioned recently is cycled again for emphasis, without a round being ejected.

      "general": "It appears that villains in the Disney Animated Canon have an especially curious tendency to exit the film by falling off or out of things. Unfortunately for them, even though they are animated characters, they cannot defy gravity.\\nThe varied list of things to fall from includes cliffs, over waterfalls, out of trees, and off the tops of buildings. There is at least one case of a Disney villain meeting his end by falling up (off a space ship and into space), once sideways (off the Chinese Imperial Palace by aid of a rocket), and another where a villain falls \\\"out\\\" by being dragged to his doom by demons. Wait, actually that's two cases of a villain being dragged to his doom by demons. Or maybe even three. Perhaps four. And a fifth example if you count the live-action films (with a *big* shot of Family-Unfriendly Death making it even worse!)\\nNote that none of these cases have to involve a Climbing Climax, though it may involve a One-Winged Angel transformation beforehand (which is by far the second-favorite trope of Disney villains).\\nSometimes, a fatal wound will be inflicted upon the villain just before taking the plunge (whether caused by the hero or by the villain's own actions) just to ensure that he or she is definitely dead. Or, they could have a boulder or similar heavy object falling down with them, which will surely crush them when they land, or fall into a deadly environment like lava or molten metal, a pit of savage beasts, fire, Hell itself, or even flesh-eating green acid, as water alone won't always do it.\\nAs with other Karmic Deaths, this is often invoked to conveniently relieve the hero of dispatching the villain himself. Heck, they may even cry \\\"Take My Hand!\\\" as they fail to Save the Villain. Their hands left bloodless, the hero and heroine can get married and live happily ever after and whatnot.\\nThis is usually invoked in order to dispatch the villain without resorting to a messier and more visible end which might upset the kids (or the Moral Guardians). Please ignore the uncomfortable realization that having the villain meet his or her end as an unquestionably ghastly mess on the floor isn't any less violent than any of the alternatives.\\nKeep in mind that you don't have to be a Disney villain to meet your end this way \\u2014 many villains and other characters in action movies, cartoons, books and other works have also met with this fate, although it's fair to say that most heroes have ways to survive taking the long fall.\\nExtremely apparent in Disney's \\\"Bronze Age\\\" (the string of late-80's-90's hits). Not to be confused with Disney Death. It seems only good guys get to have those (there is a villainous variant, but Disney doesn't use it often).\\nThere is also the non-villainous, non-conflict related variation of the trope, where a character decides to jump off a high ledge due to some stupid idea they have (eg, thinking they'd fly).\\nA subtrope of Self-Disposing Villain.\\nSee Also: High-Altitude Interrogation and Unhand Them, Villain!, as well as Death by Falling Over. When Recycled IN SPACE!, it's Thrown Out the Airlock.\\nAs a Death Trope, all Spoilers will be unmarked ahead. Beware.\\nNo Real Life Examples, Please!

      "general": "There are a lot of ways to have a character Kick the Dog or cross the Moral Event Horizon. In a war movie or battle sequence, if you want to show that a general, king, or commander is evil (really evil, not a Punch Clock Villain and way beyond a Designated Villain), all you have to do is show his casual (or utter!) disregard for the lives of his own troops by either knowingly ordering them into certain slaughter or giving an order that directly results in their deaths. Retreat is, of course, forbidden; he expects Attack! Attack! Attack! without a second thought, and a Last Stand before retreat. (And he usually does it from perfect safety.) General Failure will often upgrade this from a last resort to his preferred tactic.\\nAfter a moment like this, the character might as well have asshole printed on his forehead. Bonus points if he refers to his troops as being trash or somehow subhuman, or if he does it not because he sincerely believes that doing this is necessary to win, but in pursuit of his own glory/making a name for himself. A We Have Reserves commander is very much a Bad Boss, and a reason why there is such a high mortality rate among Redshirt Armies, Faceless Goons, Mooks, and the like.\\nNote that this does not have to be done strictly in a war setting, and works just fine if, say, the Big Bad or The Dragon decides to sacrifice someone in a Quirky Mini Boss Squad, or a small band of mooks. Employing this under such circumstances when he probably does not, in fact, have reserves, is a form of the Villain Ball.\\nCallousness is necessary for it to be a suitable Kick the Dog moment. A general who throws troops into a battle knowing they will all die but knowing a victory here will save more lives can be pardoned of it if he shows that he is aware of the cost. (Drowning My Sorrows and Bad Dreams are popular tropes for demonstrating that awareness.) After all, one cannot get through a real war with zero casualties, and some number of losses must be accepted. The same thing applies for a commander of a stricken vessel who sometimes must seal off sections of a ship and doom the crew inside lest the entire ship is lost. An inexperienced officer who inadvertently does this may only be a moron or having a moment of panic while in command for the first time, and might still be redeemable if he shows Character Development because of it or improves his tactics.\\nIn more fantastical settings, most necromancers and other undead-using sorts will gleefully send legions of their troops off to get re-killed, on the basis that no actual lives are being lost. Well, except for the enemy's. And that just adds to your own numbers. The dead do not kill, they recruit. (Depending on how the necromancy is represented, even the destroyed undead can be somewhat reconstituted.)\\nCompare Zerg Rush, Cannon Fodder, Redshirt Army (when the good side employs this) and Expendable Clone (where a character is his own reserves). Also compare The Pawns Go First, when the formidable Big Bad sends out Mooks rather than engage the fight himself. See also You Have Outlived Your Usefulness and You Have Failed Me for similar moments from a Bad Boss. Shoot the Messenger also relies on the Big Bad feeling that his mooks are completely expendable. Contrast Can't Kill You, Still Need You. The Neidermeyer is the type of officer or leader particularly likely to use this tactic, while A Father to His Men is probably the least likely.

The old standby \\\"entry tool\\\" (a small battering ram) is a better choice in most situations; the reason breaching shotguns exist at all is that a battering ram requires at least two people to operate, and the shotgun can be used to shoot bad guys too. That or a good, hard kick on an especially flimsy door. (The MythBusters have done that one, too.)\\nAttempts to shoot the lock mechanism itself tend to leave the distorted metal jammed in place while the bolt or latch remains closed. In effect, it is actually more locked than if you had left it alone.\\nThe Speculative Fiction version is shooting the control panel for the automatic door or force field, or automatic force field door. While there are doors that \\\"fail safe\\\" or \\\"fail open\\\" when power is cut, in fiction this is always coincidentally whichever the shooter and/or plot requires. (Note to villains: The Evil Overlord List recommends rigging yours to reverse this.)\\nTested on 'The Box O'Truth'.\\nNot to be confused with getting shot out of an airlock.\\nSee also \\\"Open!\\\" Says Me and There Was a Door."

      "RaidersOfTheLostArk": "In Raiders of the Lost Ark, the crew that are hired to transport Indy, his Doggone Partner and the Ark pretend to be these to try and prevent the two of them being captured by Nazis (claiming they killed Indy and planned to sell her into slavery). Interestingly it fails, but not for the reasons you'd think.\\n Most likely not, cause the Nazis were such good guys, but cause the pirates have the wrong skin color.",
      "general": "Truth in Television: Pirates still roam the waters today (mostly in regions of high political instability or weak military resolve to stop them, such as Somalia, West Africa, and the Straits of Malacca). This trope is about them.\\nUnlike their conventional counterparts, there is nothing romantic about these modern-day pirates. They tend to be completely ruthless, cold-blooded killers, devoid of honor and willing to stoop to any crime: sociopaths on the high seas. Bonus points if characters express disappointment at these pirates' failure to shiver timbers. Yet, this characterization of being honorless, psychopathic killers is exactly how pirates were viewed during the Golden Age of Piracy. Many of them lived up (or down) to this reputation. (Caveat: Many golden-age pirates were defectors from British naval press-gangs, making them essentially escaped slaves and thus occasionally sympathetic in colonial and even British literature.) Perhaps another four hundred years from now, Somalian pirates will be viewed as romantic rogues.\\nMalaysian and Indonesian pirates live up to their reputation in creative ways that would make Brutish pirates of yore proud. Instead of walking the plank, for instance, they like to leave crewmembers stranded in shallow water coral reefs 50 miles off the coast, where they have to stand on tip-toes waiting for a passing ship. This is to ensure you don't call for help while the ship is still in the vicinity \\u2014 and that is if they don't execute everyone on board. The Somalis, on the other hand, make millions on ransom alone. In fact, ransom is the main point for them; collecting a ransom is quicker, easier, and usually safer than stealing property of similar value and holding onto it long enough to find a buyer.\\nYou won't find modern pirates sailing the seven seas in visually impressive warships. That's because the entire venture cannot work without at least some decent degree of stealth from worldwide law enforcement. The use of vessels analogous to Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge or Bartholomew \\\"Black Bart\\\" Roberts' Royal Fortune would be easily visible by satellite imagery, and even if a modern pirate could take control of a hyper-fast-and-powerful ship on the level of a US Navy destroyer, most every nation in the world would almost certainly launch immediate near-limitless-resource missions to hunt down and destroy it. What's more, operating a modern warship requires resources far beyond what it took to run an effective pirate ship in the 18th century. In other words, piracy, like any other form of criminal enterprise, was forced to change with the times, or die.\\nPerhaps the closest thing they have to a Cool Ship are a few tankers and cargo ships which are larger than anything that their earlier counterparts could ever get their hands on, mostly used as mother ships.\\nRuthless Modern Pirates may also be Submarine Pirates. See also Sky Pirates and Space Pirates for specific types of modern-day/future pirates that may still retain their romanticism. For modern day pirates who still dress and act as if were the Golden Age of Piracy, see A Pirate 400 Years Too Late.\\nRelated to Ruthless Foreign Gangsters."

      "general": "An Arch Enemy, archfoe, archnemesis, or simply nemesis is some character's designated and most important enemy.\\nThe Arch Enemy can be the Big Bad, The Dragon, The Rival, an Evil Counterpart, or even a Harmless Villain. The essential element is that, with them, It's Personal. Most typically, the Arch Enemy is a foil of some sort. For example, the Arch Enemy of the physically strong could be very smart. If the villain is the Bigger Bad, his Arch Enemy commonly is the Big Good.\\nThe Arch Enemy will stand out from the Super Hero's Rogues Gallery \\u2014 there will be one opponent where the relationship to the hero and the motivations for battling them are more potent. These feelings may be one-sided, felt more by the villain than the hero, or occasionally vice-versa.\\nA hero's Arch Enemy is not necessarily the biggest threat to them. Lex Luthor is considered Superman's Arch Enemy; Brainiac is smarter and Darkseid is vastly more powerful and dangerous, but for Lex - and, to a lesser extent, for Superman - it's personal between them.\\nSometimes, the hero could have made the same choices as the Arch Enemy: the Arch Enemy is showing us what he could have become, as in the case of Batman and the Joker.\\nA hero may possess more than one Arch Enemy if more than one villain from his Rogues Gallery stand out, or if a former Arch Enemy dies and new one comes in to the picture. As an example, consider Spider-Man: the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom have all established themselves as recurring and iconic foes of Spider-Man, each of whom has been considered the wallcrawler's Arch Enemy at different points in time.\\nLastly, remember that this generally refers to the enemy the hero considers to be his Arch Enemy, and ideally, it should be personal on both sides (though there are plenty of good \\\"But for Me, It Was Tuesday\\\"-type Arch Foes out there). Especially in the case of a Rogues Gallery, the hero is usually considered an Arch Enemy to all of his villains, but he doesn't treat all of them as such. Electro, Rhino, Scorpion, and others all consider Spider-Man their most hated foe, but compared to the Goblin, Venom, or Doc Ock, Spidey regards these guys more like superpowered nuisances. Also, remember that being the Big Bad does not automatically make a villain the hero's arch enemy.\\nBeware of letting an Arch Enemy fall victim to Villain Decay.\\nSee also Breakout Villain, for those instances when a run-of-the-mill villain ascends to Arch Enemy status.\\nNot to be confused with various works known as Nemesis. Also not to be confused with the Swedish melodic death metal band. Technically, the word \\\"nemesis\\\" originally referred to an agent of divine justice or retribution for egotistical thinking; thus Batman could be described as Joker's nemesis, but not vice versa.\\nThe Arch Enemy is more prone to certain tropes than the common villain:\\n\\n Animal Nemesis\\n Antagonist in Mourning\\n Break Them by Talking\\n Cain and Abel\\n Chronic Villainy\\n Classic Villain\\n Create Your Own Villain\\n Driven by Envy\\n Enemy Mine\\n Evil Counterpart\\n Evil Former Friend\\n Evil Versus Evil\\n Friendly Enemy\\n It's Personal with the Dragon: When The Dragon rather than the Big Bad is the arch enemy in question.\\n Joker Immunity\\n Not So Different\\n The Only One Allowed to Defeat You\\n Pick on Someone Your Own Size\\n The Resenter\\n Rival Turned Evil\\n Supervillain\\n Unknown Rival\\n Villain Takes an Interest\\n Worthy Opponent"

      "general": "When someone wants to show off how skilled they are with a weapon, martial arts, acrobatics, or just plain strength, they will do some sort of flashy movement to display their skills, such as juggling knives, twirling a sword, swinging their nunchucks, flexing their pecs, bending a metal pipe, breaking a brick, or kicking and punching while doing flips.

      "general": "In fictionland, anyone caught unaware may be easily, instantaneously and noiselessly incapacitated with a single blow to the head (or alternatively, a karate chop to the neck). A character thus treated will usually be perfectly fine afterwards; at worst they may have a headache, dizziness, slightly blurred vision, or in the very worst cases, Laser-Guided Amnesia. The real danger to their health is not the aftereffects of head trauma, but the Bad Guys standing around the operating table (or other heavy piece of furniture) to which they've been tied down. In other words, being clobbered on the skull has no real lasting effects which could hinder our protagonists for the rest of the plot. (This is why In the Back does not apply \\u2014 hitting someone from behind is not really dangerous.)\\nFor obvious reasons, not Truth in Television. Most unconsciousness lasts only a few seconds, not some indeterminate amount of time lasting hours or days during which our hero can be carted around, dressed/undressed etc. For longer than a few seconds, brain damage, comas, internal bleeding, and amnesia are the result when you wake up - if you wake up.\\nThe \\\"karate chop to the neck\\\" version may have been removed from modern TV because if you hit the right spot it actually can knock you out, though not without serious risk of death. It utilizes the Carotid Sinus Reflex (the reason you should not take a pulse at the neck) and is very dangerous. There have also been depictions in productions as varied as the lighthearted I Spy and as dark as Callan in which neck-chopping unambiguously is shown to be fatal because it breaks the target's neck.\\nOther variants of the trope:\\n In Western media, there's the punch to the jaw (AKA a \\\"knockout punch\\\"). Again, in reality this could inflict serious injury to both parties. Without hand protection, the attacker could very easily break his fingers; boxers and MMA fighters wear gloves not to protect their opponents' heads (which they only partially donote\\u00A0The gloves may protect the other person's face from things like cuts and the like to an extent, but they do cause more damage to the brain since with your hands being cushioned by the gloves, you can apply more force to the other person's head, causing the brain to be hit with more force.), but to protect their own hands (which they do). Modern-day productions often depict the person throwing the punch injuring their hand in some way, sometimes for humorous effect.\\n Common in anime is the \\\"sharp shot to the solar plexus\\\", often used to subdue a struggling person. It makes it fairly easy to pick up the now-unconscious person and sling them over one's shoulder for easy carrying. Its effects are just as exaggerated as the Western version; in real life, such a blow does not cause unconsciousness but does cause the muscles of the diaphragm to spasm uncontrollably, making any activity requiring air very difficult. It is safer than a blow to the throat or the back of the head, but can occasionally lead to dangerous organ or nerve damage and is thus best avoided.\\n Choke Holds, where an arm around the neck is used to cut off blood to the brain (\\\"blood strangle/choke\\\") or oxygen to the lungs (chokehold, stranglehold). Properly applied, this is a safer and more reliable way of causing someone to become unconscious (even allowed in judo competition for many decades), but carries a risk of stroke or other dangerous problems if used on an older victim or one with a weakened circulatory system. It also tends to wear off quickly (as in, after a couple of seconds), or alternatively when it doesn't, cause varying levels of brain damage. Not depicted very often in film or TV as it's difficult to distinguish on screen between a choke hold and someone having their neck broken or being strangled to death, potentially giving the wrong impression if the intent is to show non-lethal takedowns.\\n Another variant is instant knockout caused by shattering either a vase or lamp over someone's head or even just on their back.\\n If played for laughs, the knock-out may be accompanied by Circling Birdies or a Cranial Eruption.\\nSee also Frying Pan of Doom, Rolling Pin of Doom, Back Stab, Blinded by the Light, Choke Holds, Instant Sedation, Pressure Point, Put Their Heads Together, Stun Guns, and We Need a Distraction. Contrast Death by Falling Over. Often leads to Waking Up Elsewhere. Pistol-Whipping is a Sub-Trope. Non-Lethal K.O. is a related trope in video games."

If the depressed character recovers, it will probably lead to a He's Back moment. Sometimes. If not? Time to throw him into a solitary confinement chamber.\\nThe Alcoholic is an extreme consequence of this trope played straight for long periods of time. The Hard-Drinking Party Girl does this from time to time. Characters in a Sugar Bowl replicate this in a family-friendly way by getting Drunk on Milk And Ice Cream.

Most likely to be seen in the more farcical sitcoms.\\nBamboo Technology includes the Rube Goldberg Device, but not anything that relies on magic to work. Those devices are Magitek. Pretty much sure to crop up in past-based Punk Punk settings, especially Scavenged Punk.\\nWhen the mechanisms are made with modern components cobbled together, the trope is Homemade Inventions. A subtrope of Alternate Techline, where a civilization has a technology without a precursor that's normally found with it (e.g., having automobiles without internal combustion, steel, etc.). Contrast Low Culture, High Tech, where primitive cultures use technology they didn't invent and can't comprehend. Compare Sufficiently Advanced Bamboo Technology, which is very advanced technology designed to look primitive.\\n\\nExamples"

So if you can't find them, just look for the nearest explosion. Or, if no explosions are imminent, do as the quote above and think of the place where the most potential trouble could occur and you'll end up with much the same result.\\nSuch characters tend to be Chaotic in nature. They may be heroes who frequently use plans that are Crazy Enough to Work, or just have the plain rotten luck to always cause collateral damage wherever they go no matter what they do to avoid it. Alternatively, you may have a Mad Scientist or Bungling Inventor whose creations always blow up, letting you know if they're in their lab or not. At best, they're simply inclined or compelled to find the chaos themselves. A danger zone may also be indicated by a Foreboding Fleeing Flock.\\nThe intent behind this trope is that the chaos they cause will give you an almost immediate idea of where to locate them. Finding a site of destruction and knowing that they've been there is a separate idea which involves a more protracted hunt."

Possibly, the executives have chosen a theme to market and name the series (such as the lead character's name) and the early installment is the odd man out.\\nNaturally this can be happening when you have a first work that nobody was sure was going to be popular and so they didn't think of a franchise when naming it. It can also happen during an adaptation process \\u2014 book series often also only pick up a series name much further down the line, often unofficially, and often don't bother with this process.

As startled by the characters' presence as vice versa, the whole flock explodes into flight, fluttering en masse from their roosting-place and right at the explorers' faces. Both the characters and the audience get to jump out of their skins, but the animals don't actually hurt anyone, flying away as quickly as they'd emerged.\\nMoreso than a Cat Scare, this trope is often used to emphasize the forsaken and/or unexplored nature of the site itself. While a lone cat won't hesitate to wander around near people, a whole colony of bats (or birds, moths, pterosaurs, whatever) is unlikely to settle for long in a place where humans regularly venture. Sometimes combined with Hand in the Hole for added tension. Versions in which the animals turn out to be fleeing from something much more dangerous are common.\\nVariants with non-winged creatures also occur, but tend to lack the same in-your-face impact of flying ones, so usually rely on animals (rats, spiders) that audiences would find creepy in any case.\\nCompare Disturbed Doves, in which doves take flight to symbolize a dramatic event. Contrast Wallet Moths, which also indicates a vacancy (of money), but isn't played for scares."

Unfortunately, there's a huge crowd between him and his goal, and for whatever reason, shouting at them to get out of his way just isn't cutting it. His only option is to weave his way through the crowd Frogger-style; changing speeds, cutting left and right to avoid clumps of people, and sometimes even ducking under carried objects and jumping over the incidental obstacles like benches and garbage cans. Generally, if the person is being chased or is fleeing a scene, they'll not even bother dodging, preferring to just bull their way through a crowd as best they can. (Naturally, the hero has to be nicer about it than the villain.) Of course, if the person being chased does this right, they tend to be Lost in a Crowd. If the hero is holding onto a MacGuffin, odds are he'll lose it, and have to play a game of Crowd Hockey in order to get it back.\\nIf one half of a couple is about to leave on a plane/boat/train/whatever, the odds that the other person will have to run the Mobstacle Course increase exponentially.\\nThis can often be in a scary dream sequence: the character is doing their best to move forward in the crowd, only to find that said crowd is getting denser and denser, resulting in the character being swept away as if in a tidal wave. Happens quite a bit in Crime and Punishment Series with the \\\"Cop(s) chasing Suspect(s)\\\" version.\\nOften a case of Truth in Television. Occasionally Played for Laughs. Compare to Excuse Me Coming Through, where the crowd parts just when the hero or villain needs it to. If the character chooses a more direct path through the masses, it's a Foe-Tossing Charge.

It's downright frightening when the smile is in anticipation of pain or death \\u2014 yours, probably. Needless to say, the Slasher Smile does not inspire warmth in anyone who sees it.\\nThe Slasher Smile is the evil sibling of the Cheshire Cat Grin. In general, the difference is in the eyes of the character. If the eyes sparkle, or are mischievously wicked, it's a Cheshire Cat Grin. If, however, the eyes are clearly crazy or malevolent, it's a Slasher Smile. If the grinning person is holding a knife or an axe or some other implement of painful and often bloody death, it's best to assume the worst.\\nWhile the Cheshire Cat Grin is a staple of The Trickster, generally one of the good guys, the Slasher Smile is the staple of the Ax-Crazy, unless said hero is a particularly dark or vicious Anti-Hero. Only expect to see a \\\"nice\\\" hero with a Slasher Smile if they've been possessed or suffered a major Freak Out or if they have been taken over by their Super-Powered Evil Side. Also, a devious Chessmaster or Magnificent Bastard is unlikely to look like this - it's too Obviously Evil, and they prefer the subtler Psychotic Smirk.\\nNo, the Slasher Smile is more appropriate for The Dragon, the Mad Scientist, and most especially Serial Killers, but it can happen with any character who is gleefully violent and/or fits any \\\"wild crazy person\\\" stereotypes. Beings who hunt and eat victims we are supposed to identify with will also often have Slasher Smiles... in their case, it means \\\"Hello, lunch!\\\"\\nSome characters with a Slasher Smile wear the grin all the time \\u2014 in fact, it's physically impossible for them to move their face out of it. For many, this has the added worry of making it harder to tell what they're thinking or feeling, because their face betrays no expression beyond the smile.\\nNot to be confused with a Slashed Smile (although they sometimes overlap), and has nothing to do with the pleased smiles of Slash Fic fans upon the detection of impending Ho Yay. Hopefully.\\nContrast Dissonant Serenity for a calm mood which isn't the slightest bit more reassuring. When the smile is merely creepy, it's The Un-Smile. May be part of the fear behind the Monster Clown. See also Technically a Smile. Also contrast Grin of Audacity.\\n\\nExamples"

This appears most often for military footage, when the producers don't have the budget to shoot a convincing battle scene and aren't Backed by the Pentagon. In such cases, the quality of the Stock Footage can be substantially different (and several decades older), making for an especially jarring effect. On the other hand, historical fiction dealing with (for example) World War II or the Vietnam War, may deliberately use period-era footage as stock. As a stylistic choice, it can help with the mood of the story a lot.\\nWith digital compositing and other effects, one can stretch the stock footage further. A single effects shot can be overlaid into many scenes. In animation, data is often stored in layers, either as original animation cels or digital files, allowing character animation to be re-used on new backgrounds, sometimes reversed.\\nOccasionally, stock footage from other sources is used in cartoons for comedic effect; a series of stock footage clips are shown, each one more absurd than the last.\\nNot to be confused with the Avatar and the Airbending Fellowship of Vampire Slayers episode \\\"Stock Footage\\\".\\nCompare Limited Animation, and for news reporting, B Roll.\\n\\nExamples"
